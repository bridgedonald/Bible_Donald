<h3><span class="text Luke-16-1" id="en-CEV-23570">A Dishonest Manager</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Luke-16-1"><span class="chapternum">16 </span>Jesus said to his disciples:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Luke-16-1">A rich man once had a manager to take care of his business. But he was told that his manager was wasting money. </span> <span class="text Luke-16-2" id="en-CEV-23571"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>So the rich man called him in and said, “What is this I hear about you? Tell me what you have done! You are no longer going to work for me.”</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Luke-16-3" id="en-CEV-23572"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>The manager said to himself, “What shall I do now that my master is going to fire me? I can't dig ditches, and I'm ashamed to beg. </span> <span class="text Luke-16-4" id="en-CEV-23573"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>I know what I'll do, so that people will welcome me into their homes after I've lost my job.”</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Luke-16-5" id="en-CEV-23574"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Then one by one he called in the people who were in debt to his master. He asked the first one, “How much do you owe my master?”</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Luke-16-6" id="en-CEV-23575"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>“A hundred barrels of olive oil,” the man answered.</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Luke-16-6">So the manager said, “Take your bill and sit down and quickly write ‘50.’ ”</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Luke-16-7" id="en-CEV-23576"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>The manager asked someone else who was in debt to his master, “How much do you owe?”</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Luke-16-7">“A thousand sacks<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-23576a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-23576a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-23576a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> of wheat,” the man replied.</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Luke-16-7">The manager said, “Take your bill and write ‘800.’ ”</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Luke-16-8" id="en-CEV-23577"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>The master praised his dishonest manager for looking out for himself so well. That's how it is! The people of this world look out for themselves better than the people who belong to the light.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Luke-16-9" id="en-CEV-23578"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup> My disciples, I tell you to use wicked wealth to make friends for yourselves. Then when it is gone, you will be welcomed into an eternal home. </span> <span class="text Luke-16-10" id="en-CEV-23579"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Anyone who can be trusted in little matters can also be trusted in important matters. But anyone who is dishonest in little matters will be dishonest in important matters. </span> <span class="text Luke-16-11" id="en-CEV-23580"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>If you cannot be trusted with this wicked wealth, who will trust you with true wealth? </span> <span class="text Luke-16-12" id="en-CEV-23581"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>And if you cannot be trusted with what belongs to someone else, who will give you something that will be your own? </span> <span class="text Luke-16-13" id="en-CEV-23582"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup> You cannot be the slave of two masters. You will like one more than the other or be more loyal to one than to the other. You cannot serve God and money.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Luke-16-14" id="en-CEV-23583">Some Sayings of Jesus</span></h3><h4 class="reference"><span class="text Luke-16-14">(<a class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Matt.11.12" href="/passage/?search=Matt.11.12&amp;version=CEV">Matthew 11.12</a>,<a class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Matt.11.13" href="/passage/?search=Matt.11.13&amp;version=CEV">13</a>; <a class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Matt.5.31" href="/passage/?search=Matt.5.31&amp;version=CEV">5.31</a>,<a class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Matt.5.32" href="/passage/?search=Matt.5.32&amp;version=CEV">32</a>; <a class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Mark.10.11" href="/passage/?search=Mark.10.11&amp;version=CEV">Mark 10.11</a>,<a class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Mark.10.12" href="/passage/?search=Mark.10.12&amp;version=CEV">12</a>)</span></h4><p><span class="text Luke-16-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>The Pharisees really loved money.
