But you can be sure that if you don't turn back to God, every one of you will also be killed. </span> <span class="text Luke-13-4" id="en-CEV-23471"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>What about those 18 people who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them? Do you think they were worse than everyone else in Jerusalem? </span> <span class="text Luke-13-5" id="en-CEV-23472"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Not at all! But you can be sure that if you don't turn back to God, every one of you will also die.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Luke-13-6" id="en-CEV-23473">A Story about a Fig Tree</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-13-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Jesus then told them this story:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Luke-13-6">A man had a fig tree growing in his vineyard. One day he went out to pick some figs, but he didn't find any. </span> <span class="text Luke-13-7" id="en-CEV-23474"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>So he said to the gardener, “For three years I have come looking for figs on this tree, and I haven't found any yet. Chop it down! Why should it take up space?”</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Luke-13-8" id="en-CEV-23475"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>The gardener answered, “Master, leave it for another year. I'll dig around it and put some manure on it to make it grow. </span> <span class="text Luke-13-9" id="en-CEV-23476"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Maybe it will have figs on it next year. If it doesn't, you can have it cut down.”</span></p> <h3><span class="text Luke-13-10" id="en-CEV-23477">Healing a Woman on the Sabbath</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-13-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>One Sabbath, Jesus was teaching in a synagogue, </span> <span class="text Luke-13-11" id="en-CEV-23478"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>and a woman was there who had been crippled by an evil spirit for 18 years. She was completely bent over and could not straighten up. </span> <span class="text Luke-13-12" id="en-CEV-23479"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>When Jesus saw the woman, he called her over and said, “You are now well.” </span> <span class="text Luke-13-13" id="en-CEV-23480"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>He placed his hands on her, and at once she stood up straight and praised God.</span></p> <p><span class="text Luke-13-14" id="en-CEV-23481"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup> The man in charge of the synagogue was angry because Jesus had healed someone on the Sabbath. So he said to the people, “Each week has six days when we can work. Come and be healed on one of those days, but not on the Sabbath.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Luke-13-15" id="en-CEV-23482"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>The Lord replied, “Are you trying to fool someone? Won't any one of you untie your ox or donkey and lead it out to drink on a Sabbath? </span> <span class="text Luke-13-16" id="en-CEV-23483"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>This woman belongs to the family of Abraham, but Satan has kept her bound for 18 years.

But everyone else in the crowd was happy about the wonderful things he was doing.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Luke-13-18" id="en-CEV-23485">A Mustard Seed and Yeast</span></h3><h4 class="reference"><span class="text Luke-13-18">(<a class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Matt.13.31-Matt.13.33" href="/passage/?search=Matt.13.31-Matt.13.33&amp;version=CEV">Matthew 13.31-33</a>; <a class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Mark.4.30-Mark.4.32" href="/passage/?search=Mark.4.30-Mark.4.32&amp;version=CEV">Mark 4.30-32</a>)</span></h4><p><span class="text Luke-13-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Jesus said, “What is God's kingdom like?
