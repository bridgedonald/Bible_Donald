Then he healed him and sent him away. </span> <span class="text Luke-14-5" id="en-CEV-23507"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup> Afterwards, Jesus asked the people, “If your son or ox falls into a well, wouldn't you pull him out at once, even on the Sabbath?” </span> <span class="text Luke-14-6" id="en-CEV-23508"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>There was nothing they could say.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Luke-14-7" id="en-CEV-23509">How To Be a Guest</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-14-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Jesus saw how the guests had tried to take the best seats.

But if you humble yourself, you will be honored.</span></p> <p><span class="text Luke-14-12" id="en-CEV-23514"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Then Jesus said to the man who had invited him:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Luke-14-12">When you give a dinner or a banquet, don't invite your friends and family and relatives and rich neighbors. If you do, they will invite you in return, and you will be paid back. </span> <span class="text Luke-14-13" id="en-CEV-23515"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>When you give a feast, invite the poor, the paralyzed, the lame, and the blind. </span> <span class="text Luke-14-14" id="en-CEV-23516"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>They cannot pay you back.
