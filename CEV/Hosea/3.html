<h3><span class="text Hos-3-1" id="en-CEV-20131">God's Love Offers Hope</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Hos-3-1"><span class="chapternum">3 </span>Once again the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> spoke to me. And this time he said, “Hosea, fall in love with an unfaithful woman<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-20131a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-20131a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-20131a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> who has a lover. Do this to show that I love the people of Israel, even though they worship idols and enjoy the offering cakes made with fruit.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Hos-3-2" id="en-CEV-20132"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>So I paid 15 pieces of silver and about 150 kilograms of grain for such a woman. </span> <span class="text Hos-3-3" id="en-CEV-20133"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Then I said, “Now you are mine! You will have to remain faithful to me, though it will be a long time before we sleep together.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Hos-3-4" id="en-CEV-20134"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>It will also be a long time before Israel has a king or before sacrifices are offered at the temple or before there is any way to get guidance from God. </span> <span class="text Hos-3-5" id="en-CEV-20135"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>But later, Israel will turn back to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> their God and to David their king. At that time they will come to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> with fear and trembling, and he will be good to them.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
