Patiently put up with each other and love each other. </span> <span class="text Eph-4-3" id="en-CEV-27166"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Try your best to let God's Spirit keep your hearts united. Do this by living at peace. </span> <span class="text Eph-4-4" id="en-CEV-27167"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>All of you are part of the same body. There is only one Spirit of God, just as you were given one hope when you were chosen to be God's people. </span> <span class="text Eph-4-5" id="en-CEV-27168"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>We have only one Lord, one faith, and one baptism. </span> <span class="text Eph-4-6" id="en-CEV-27169"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>There is one God who is the Father of all people. Not only is God above all others, but he works by using all of us, and he lives in all of us.</span></p> <p><span class="text Eph-4-7" id="en-CEV-27170"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Christ has generously divided out his gifts to us. </span> <span class="text Eph-4-8" id="en-CEV-27171"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup> As the Scriptures say,</span></p><div class="poetry"><p class="line"><span class="text Eph-4-8">“When he went up</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Eph-4-8">to the highest place,</span></span><br/><span class="text Eph-4-8">he led away many prisoners</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Eph-4-8">and gave gifts to people.”</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1"><span class="text Eph-4-9" id="en-CEV-27172"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>When it says, “he went up,” it means that Christ had been deep in the earth. </span> <span class="text Eph-4-10" id="en-CEV-27173"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>This also means that the one who went deep into the earth is the same one who went into the highest heaven, so he would fill the whole universe.</span></p> <p><span class="text Eph-4-11" id="en-CEV-27174"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Christ chose some of us to be apostles, prophets, missionaries, pastors, and teachers, </span> <span class="text Eph-4-12" id="en-CEV-27175"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>so his people would learn to serve and his body would grow strong. </span> <span class="text Eph-4-13" id="en-CEV-27176"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>This will continue until we are united by our faith and by our understanding of the Son of God. Then we will be mature, just as Christ is, and we will be completely like him.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27176a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27176a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27176a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text Eph-4-14" id="en-CEV-27177"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>We must stop acting like children.

Then we will grow in every way and be more like Christ, the head </span> <span class="text Eph-4-16" id="en-CEV-27179"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup> of the body. Christ holds it together and makes all of its parts work perfectly, as it grows and becomes strong because of love.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Eph-4-17" id="en-CEV-27180">The Old Life and the New Life</span></h3><p><span class="text Eph-4-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>As a follower of the Lord, I order you to stop living like stupid, godless people. </span> <span class="text Eph-4-18" id="en-CEV-27181"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Their minds are in the dark, and they are stubborn and ignorant and have missed out on the life that comes from God. They no longer have any feelings about what is right, </span> <span class="text Eph-4-19" id="en-CEV-27182"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>and they are so greedy they do all kinds of indecent things.</span></p> <p><span class="text Eph-4-20-Eph-4-21" id="en-CEV-27183"><sup class="versenum">20-21 </sup>But this isn't what you were taught about Jesus Christ.
