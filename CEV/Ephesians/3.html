<h3><span class="text Eph-3-1" id="en-CEV-27144">Paul's Mission to the Gentiles</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Eph-3-1"><span class="chapternum">3 </span>Christ Jesus made me his prisoner, so I could help you Gentiles. </span> <span class="text Eph-3-2" id="en-CEV-27145"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>You have surely heard about God's gift of undeserved grace in choosing me to help you. </span> <span class="text Eph-3-3" id="en-CEV-27146"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>In fact, this letter tells you a little about how God has shown me his mysterious ways. </span> <span class="text Eph-3-4" id="en-CEV-27147"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup> As you read the letter, you will also find out how well I really do understand the mystery about Christ. </span> <span class="text Eph-3-5" id="en-CEV-27148"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>No one knew about this mystery until God's Spirit told it to his holy apostles and prophets. </span> <span class="text Eph-3-6" id="en-CEV-27149"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>And the mystery is this: Because of Christ Jesus, the good news has given the Gentiles a share in the promises God gave to the Jews. God has also let the Gentiles be part of the same body.</span></p> <p><span class="text Eph-3-7" id="en-CEV-27150"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>God treated me with kindness. His power worked in me, and it became my job to spread the good news. </span> <span class="text Eph-3-8" id="en-CEV-27151"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>I am the least important of all God's people. But God was kind and chose me to tell the Gentiles that because of Christ there are blessings that cannot be measured. </span> <span class="text Eph-3-9" id="en-CEV-27152"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup> God, who created everything, wanted me to help everyone understand the mysterious plan that had always been hidden in his mind. </span> <span class="text Eph-3-10" id="en-CEV-27153"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Then God would use the church to show the powers and authorities in the spiritual world that he has many different kinds of wisdom.</span></p> <p><span class="text Eph-3-11" id="en-CEV-27154"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>God did this according to his eternal plan. And he was able to do what he had planned because of all Christ Jesus our Lord had done. </span> <span class="text Eph-3-12" id="en-CEV-27155"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Christ now gives us courage and confidence, so we can come to God by faith. </span> <span class="text Eph-3-13" id="en-CEV-27156"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>This is why you should not be discouraged when I suffer for you. After all, it will bring honor to you.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Eph-3-14" id="en-CEV-27157">Christ's Love for Us</span></h3><p><span class="text Eph-3-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>I kneel in prayer to the Father. </span> <span class="text Eph-3-15" id="en-CEV-27158"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>All beings in heaven and on earth receive their life from him.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27158a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27158a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27158a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Eph-3-16" id="en-CEV-27159"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>God is wonderful and glorious. I pray that his Spirit will make you become strong followers </span> <span class="text Eph-3-17" id="en-CEV-27160"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>and that Christ will live in your hearts because of your faith. Stand firm and be deeply rooted in his love. </span> <span class="text Eph-3-18" id="en-CEV-27161"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup> I pray that you and all God's people will understand what is called wide or long or high or deep.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27161b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27161b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27161b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Eph-3-19" id="en-CEV-27162"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>I want you to know all about Christ's love, although it is too wonderful to be measured. Then your lives will be filled with all that God is.</span></p> <p><span class="text Eph-3-20-Eph-3-21" id="en-CEV-27163"><sup class="versenum">20-21 </sup>I pray that Christ Jesus and the church will forever bring praise to God. His power at work in us can do far more than we dare ask or imagine. Amen.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
