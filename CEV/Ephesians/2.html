<h3><span class="text Eph-2-1" id="en-CEV-27123">From Death to Life</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Eph-2-1"><span class="chapternum">2 </span> In the past you were dead because you sinned and fought against God. </span> <span class="text Eph-2-2" id="en-CEV-27124"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>You followed the ways of this world and obeyed the devil. He rules the world, and his spirit has power over everyone who doesn't obey God. </span> <span class="text Eph-2-3" id="en-CEV-27125"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Once we were also ruled by the selfish desires of our bodies and minds. We had made God angry, and we were going to be punished like everyone else.</span></p> <p><span class="text Eph-2-4-Eph-2-5" id="en-CEV-27126"><sup class="versenum">4-5 </sup>But God was merciful! We were dead because of our sins, but God loved us so much he made us alive with Christ, and God's gift of undeserved grace is what saves you. </span> <span class="text Eph-2-6" id="en-CEV-27127"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>God raised us from death to life with Christ Jesus, and he has given us a place beside Christ in heaven. </span> <span class="text Eph-2-7" id="en-CEV-27128"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>God did this so in the future world he could show how truly good and kind he is to us because of what Christ Jesus has done. </span> <span class="text Eph-2-8" id="en-CEV-27129"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>You were saved by faith in God, who treats us much better than we deserve.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27129a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27129a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27129a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> This is God's gift to you, and not anything you have done on your own. </span> <span class="text Eph-2-9" id="en-CEV-27130"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>It isn't something you have earned, so there is nothing you can brag about. </span> <span class="text Eph-2-10" id="en-CEV-27131"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>God planned for us to do good things and to live as he has always wanted us to live. This is why he sent Christ to make us what we are.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Eph-2-11" id="en-CEV-27132">United by Christ</span></h3><p><span class="text Eph-2-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Don't forget that you are Gentiles. In fact, you used to be called “uncircumcised” by those who take pride in being circumcised. </span> <span class="text Eph-2-12" id="en-CEV-27133"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>At that time you did not know about Christ. You were foreigners to the people of Israel, and you had no part in the promises God had made to them. You were living in this world without hope and without God, </span> <span class="text Eph-2-13" id="en-CEV-27134"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>and you were far from God. But Christ offered his life's blood as a sacrifice and brought you near God.</span></p> <p><span class="text Eph-2-14" id="en-CEV-27135"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Christ has made peace between Jews and Gentiles, and he has united us by breaking down the wall of hatred that separated us. Christ gave his own body </span> <span class="text Eph-2-15" id="en-CEV-27136"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup> to destroy the Law of Moses with all its rules and commands. He even brought Jews and Gentiles together as though we were only one person, when he united us in peace. </span> <span class="text Eph-2-16" id="en-CEV-27137"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup> On the cross Christ did away with our hatred for each other. He also made peace<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27137b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27137b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27137b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> between us and God by uniting Jews and Gentiles in one body. </span> <span class="text Eph-2-17" id="en-CEV-27138"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup> Christ came and preached peace to you Gentiles, who were far from God, and peace to us Jews, who were near God. </span> <span class="text Eph-2-18" id="en-CEV-27139"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>And because of Christ, all of us can come to the Father by the same Spirit.</span></p> <p><span class="text Eph-2-19" id="en-CEV-27140"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>You Gentiles are no longer strangers and foreigners. You are citizens with everyone else who belongs to the family of God. </span> <span class="text Eph-2-20" id="en-CEV-27141"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>You are like a building with the apostles and prophets as the foundation and with Christ as the most important stone. </span> <span class="text Eph-2-21" id="en-CEV-27142"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Christ is the one who holds the building together and makes it grow into a holy temple for the Lord. </span> <span class="text Eph-2-22" id="en-CEV-27143"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>And you are part of that building Christ has built as a place for God's own Spirit to live.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
