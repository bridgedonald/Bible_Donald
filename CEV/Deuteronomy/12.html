<h3><span class="text Deut-12-1" id="en-CEV-4478">Only One Place To Worship the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span></h3><h4 class="speaker"><span class="text Deut-12-1">Moses said to Israel:</span></h4><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Deut-12-1"><span class="chapternum">12 </span>Now I'll tell you the laws and teachings that you have to obey as long as you live. Your ancestors worshiped the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, and he is giving you this land. </span> <span class="text Deut-12-2" id="en-CEV-4479"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>But the nations that live there worship other gods. So after you capture the land, you must completely destroy their places of worship—on mountains and hills or in the shade of large trees. </span> <span class="text Deut-12-3" id="en-CEV-4480"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup> Wherever these nations worship their gods, you must tear down their altars, break their sacred stones, burn the sacred poles<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-4480a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-4480a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-4480a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> used in worshiping the goddess Asherah, and smash their idols to pieces. Destroy these places of worship so completely that no one will remember they were ever there. </span> <span class="text Deut-12-4" id="en-CEV-4481"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Don't worship the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> your God in the way those nations worship their gods.</span></p> <p><span class="text Deut-12-5-Deut-12-19" id="en-CEV-4482"><sup class="versenum">5-19 </sup> Soon you will cross the Jordan, and the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will help you conquer your enemies and let you live in peace, there in the land he has given you. But after you are settled, life will be different. You must not offer sacrifices just anywhere you want to. Instead, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will choose a place somewhere in Israel where you must go to worship him. All of your sacrifices and offerings must be taken there, including sacrifices to please the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span><sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-4482b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-4482b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-4482b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> and any gift you promise or voluntarily give him.

And since Levites will not have any land of their own, you must ask some of them to come along and celebrate with you.</span></p><p><span class="text Deut-12-5-Deut-12-19">Sometimes you may want to kill an animal for food and not as a sacrifice. If the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has blessed you and given you enough cows or sheep or goats, then you can butcher one of them where you live. You can eat it just like the meat from a deer or gazelle that you kill when you go hunting. And even those people who are unclean and unfit for worship can have some of the meat. But you must not eat the blood of any animal—let the blood drain out on the ground.</span></p> <p><span class="text Deut-12-20-Deut-12-21" id="en-CEV-4483"><sup class="versenum">20-21 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has promised that later on he will give Israel more land, and some of you may not be able to travel all the way from your homes to the place of worship each time you are hungry for meat.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-4483f" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-4483f" title="See footnote f"&gt;f&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-4483f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> But the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will give you cattle, sheep, and goats, and you can butcher any of those animals at home and eat as much as you want. </span> <span class="text Deut-12-22" id="en-CEV-4484"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>It is the same as eating the meat from a deer or a gazelle that you kill when you go hunting.

If you offer a sacrifice to please the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, all of its meat must be burned on the altar. You can eat the meat from certain kinds of sacrifices, but you must always pour out the animal's blood on the altar.</span></p> <p><span class="text Deut-12-28" id="en-CEV-4488"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>If you obey these laws, you will be doing what the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> your God says is right and good.
