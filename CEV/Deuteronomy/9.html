You will soon cross the Jordan River and go into the land to force out the nations that live there. They are more powerful than you are, and the walls around their cities reach to the sky. </span> <span class="text Deut-9-2" id="en-CEV-4403"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Some of these nations are descendants of the Anakim.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-4403a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-4403a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-4403a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> You know how tall and strong they are, and you've heard that no one can defeat them in battle. </span> <span class="text Deut-9-3" id="en-CEV-4404"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>But the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> your God has promised to go ahead of you, like a raging fire burning everything in its path. So when you attack your enemies, it will be easy for you to destroy them and take their land.</span></p> <p><span class="text Deut-9-4-Deut-9-6" id="en-CEV-4405"><sup class="versenum">4-6 </sup>After the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> helps you wipe out these nations and conquer their land, don't think he did it because you are such good people. You aren't good—you are stubborn! No, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> is going to help you, because the nations that live there are evil, and because he wants to keep the promise he made to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Deut-9-7" id="en-CEV-4406">When Israel Made an Idol</span></h3><h4 class="reference"><span class="text Deut-9-7">(<a class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Exod.32" href="/passage/?search=Exod.32&amp;version=CEV">Exodus 32</a>)</span></h4><h4 class="speaker"><span class="text Deut-9-7">Moses said to Israel:</span></h4><p><span class="text Deut-9-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Don't ever forget how you kept rebelling and making the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> angry the whole time you were in the desert.

So I prayed for you and Aaron as I had done before, and this time the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> answered my prayers.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-4415d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-4415d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-4415d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text Deut-9-21" id="en-CEV-4416"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>It was a sin for you to make that idol, so I threw it into the fire to melt it down.
