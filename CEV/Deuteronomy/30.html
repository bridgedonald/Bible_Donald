He will scatter you in faraway countries, but when you realize that he is punishing you, </span> <span class="text Deut-30-2" id="en-CEV-4849"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>return to him with all your heart and soul and start obeying the commands I have given to you today. </span> <span class="text Deut-30-3-Deut-30-4" id="en-CEV-4850"><sup class="versenum">3-4 </sup>Then he will stop punishing you and treat you with kindness. He may have scattered you to the farthest countries on earth, but he will bring you back </span> <span class="text Deut-30-5" id="en-CEV-4851"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>to the land that had belonged to your ancestors and make you even more successful and powerful than they ever were.</span></p> <p><span class="text Deut-30-6" id="en-CEV-4852"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>You and your descendants are stubborn, but the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will make you willing to obey him and love him with all your heart and soul, and you will enjoy a long life.</span></p> <p><span class="text Deut-30-7" id="en-CEV-4853"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Then the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> your God will remove the curses from you and put them on those enemies who hate and attack you.</span></p> <p><span class="text Deut-30-8" id="en-CEV-4854"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>You will again obey the laws and teachings of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, </span> <span class="text Deut-30-9" id="en-CEV-4855"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>and he will bless you with many children, large herds and flocks, and abundant crops.

They are in heaven, and no one can go up to get them, then bring them down and explain them to us.” </span> <span class="text Deut-30-13" id="en-CEV-4859"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>And you can't say, “How can we obey the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s commands? They are across the sea, and someone must go across, then bring them back and explain them to us.” </span> <span class="text Deut-30-14" id="en-CEV-4860"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>No, these commands are nearby and you know them by heart. All you have to do is obey!</span></p> <p><span class="text Deut-30-15" id="en-CEV-4861"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup> Today I am giving you a choice. You can choose life and success or death and disaster. </span> <span class="text Deut-30-16-Deut-30-18" id="en-CEV-4862"><sup class="versenum">16-18 </sup>I am commanding you to be loyal to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, to live the way he has told you, and to obey his laws and teachings. You are about to cross the Jordan River and take the land that he is giving you. If you obey him, you will live and become successful and powerful.</span></p><p><span class="text Deut-30-16-Deut-30-18">On the other hand, you might choose to disobey the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> and reject him. So I'm warning you that if you bow down and worship other gods, you won't have long to live.</span></p> <p><span class="text Deut-30-19" id="en-CEV-4863"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Now I call the sky and the earth to be witnesses that I am offering you this choice. Will you choose for the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> to make you prosperous and give you a long life? Or will he put you under a curse and kill you? Choose life! </span> <span class="text Deut-30-20" id="en-CEV-4864"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup> Be completely faithful to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> your God, love him, and do whatever he tells you. The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> is the only one who can give life, and he will let you live a long time in the land that he promised to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</span></p>  <!--end of crossrefs-->
