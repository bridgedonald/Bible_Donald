Once they reach the valley, the leaders will break the cow's neck.</span></p><p><span class="text Deut-21-4-Deut-21-5">The priests must be there, because the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> your God has chosen them to be his special servants at the place of worship. The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has chosen them to bless the people in his name and to be judges in all legal cases, whether property or injury is involved.</span></p> <p><span class="text Deut-21-6" id="en-CEV-4632"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>The town leaders will wash their hands over the body of the dead cow </span> <span class="text Deut-21-7" id="en-CEV-4633"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>and say, “We had no part in this murder, and we don't know who did it. </span> <span class="text Deut-21-8-Deut-21-9" id="en-CEV-4634"><sup class="versenum">8-9 </sup>But since an innocent person was murdered, we beg you, our <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, to accept this sacrifice and forgive Israel. We are your people, and you rescued us. Please don't hold this crime against us.”</span></p><p><span class="text Deut-21-8-Deut-21-9">If you obey the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> and do these things, he will forgive Israel.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Deut-21-10" id="en-CEV-4635">Marrying a Woman Taken Prisoner in War</span></h3><h4 class="speaker"><span class="text Deut-21-10">Moses said to Israel:</span></h4><p><span class="text Deut-21-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>From time to time, you men will serve as soldiers and go off to war. The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> your God will help you defeat your enemies, and you will take many prisoners. </span> <span class="text Deut-21-11-Deut-21-13" id="en-CEV-4636"><sup class="versenum">11-13 </sup>One of these prisoners may be a beautiful woman, and you may want to marry her. But first you must bring her into your home, and have her shave her head, cut her nails, get rid of her foreign clothes, and start wearing Israelite clothes. She will mourn a month for her father and mother, then you can marry her.</span></p> <p><span class="text Deut-21-14" id="en-CEV-4637"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Later on, if you are not happy with the woman, you can divorce her, and she can go free. But you have slept with her as your wife, so you cannot sell her as a slave or make her into your own slave.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Deut-21-15-Deut-21-17" id="en-CEV-4638">Rights of a First-Born Son</span></h3><h4 class="speaker"><span class="text Deut-21-15-Deut-21-17">Moses said to Israel:</span></h4><p><span class="text Deut-21-15-Deut-21-17"><sup class="versenum">15-17 </sup>Suppose a man has two wives and loves one more than the other. The first son of either wife is the man's first-born son, even if the boy's mother is the wife the man doesn't love. Later, when the man is near death and is dividing up his property, he must give a double share to his first-born son, simply because he was the first to be born.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Deut-21-18" id="en-CEV-4639">A Son Who Rebels</span></h3><h4 class="speaker"><span class="text Deut-21-18">Moses said to Israel:</span></h4><p><span class="text Deut-21-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>A father and a mother may have a stubborn and rebellious son who refuses to obey them even after he has been punished. </span> <span class="text Deut-21-19" id="en-CEV-4640"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>If a son is like that, his parents must drag him to the town gate, where the leaders of the town hold their meetings. </span> <span class="text Deut-21-20" id="en-CEV-4641"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>The parents will tell the leaders, “This son of ours is stubborn and never obeys. He spends all his time drinking and partying.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Deut-21-21" id="en-CEV-4642"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>The men of the town will stone that son to death, because they must get rid of the evil he brought into the community. Everyone in Israel will be afraid when they hear how he was punished.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Deut-21-22" id="en-CEV-4643">The Body of a Criminal</span></h3><h4 class="speaker"><span class="text Deut-21-22">Moses said to Israel:</span></h4><p><span class="text Deut-21-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>If a criminal is put to death, and you hang the dead body on a tree, </span> <span class="text Deut-21-23" id="en-CEV-4644"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup> you must not leave it there overnight. Bury it the same day, because the dead body of a criminal hanging on a tree will bring God's curse on the land. The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> your God is giving this land to you, so don't make it unclean by leaving the bodies of executed criminals on display.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
