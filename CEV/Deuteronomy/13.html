Then the prophet may say, “Let's start worshiping some new gods—some gods that we know nothing about.” </span> <span class="text Deut-13-3" id="en-CEV-4494"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>If the prophet says this, don't listen! The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> your God will be watching to find out whether or not you love him with all your heart and soul. </span> <span class="text Deut-13-4" id="en-CEV-4495"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>You must be completely faithful to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>.

But you must not listen to people who say such things. Instead, you must stone them to death. You must be the first to throw the stones, then others from the community will finish the job. Don't show any pity.</span></p><p><span class="text Deut-13-6-Deut-13-10">The gods worshiped by other nations have never done anything for you or your ancestors. People who ask you to worship other gods are trying to get you to stop worshiping the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, who rescued you from slavery in Egypt. So put to death anyone who asks you to worship another god. </span> <span class="text Deut-13-11" id="en-CEV-4498"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>And when the rest of Israel hears about it, they will be afraid, and no one else will ever do such an evil thing again.</span></p> <p><span class="text Deut-13-12" id="en-CEV-4499"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>After the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> your God gives you towns to live in, you may hear a rumor about one of the towns. </span> <span class="text Deut-13-13" id="en-CEV-4500"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>You may hear that some worthless people have talked everyone there into worshiping other gods, even though these gods had never done anything for them. </span> <span class="text Deut-13-14" id="en-CEV-4501"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>You must carefully find out if the rumor is true. Then if the people of that town have actually done such a disgusting thing in your own country, </span> <span class="text Deut-13-15" id="en-CEV-4502"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>you must take your swords and kill every one of them, and their livestock too. </span> <span class="text Deut-13-16-Deut-13-17" id="en-CEV-4503"><sup class="versenum">16-17 </sup>Gather all the possessions of the people who lived there, and pile them up in the marketplace, without keeping anything for yourself. Set the pile and the whole town on fire, and don't ever rebuild the town. The whole town will be a sacrifice to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> your God.
