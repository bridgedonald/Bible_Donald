If you obey them, you will live, and you will go in and take the land that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> is giving you. He is the God your ancestors worshiped, </span> <span class="text Deut-4-2" id="en-CEV-4267"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup> and now he is your God. I am telling you everything he has commanded, so don't add anything or take anything away.</span></p> <p><span class="text Deut-4-3" id="en-CEV-4268"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup> You saw how he killed everyone who worshiped the god Baal Peor.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-4268a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-4268a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-4268a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Deut-4-4" id="en-CEV-4269"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>But all of you that were faithful to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> your God are still alive today.</span></p> <p><span class="text Deut-4-5-Deut-4-8" id="en-CEV-4270"><sup class="versenum">5-8 </sup> No other nation has laws that are as fair as the ones the Lord my God told me to give you. If you faithfully obey them when you enter the land, you will show other nations how wise you are. In fact, everyone that hears about your laws will say, “That great nation certainly is wise!” And what makes us greater than other nations? We have a God who is close to us and answers our prayers.</span></p> <p><span class="text Deut-4-9" id="en-CEV-4271"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>You must be very careful not to forget the things you have seen God do for you.

After many years, you might lose your sense of right and wrong and make idols, even though the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> your God hates them. So I am giving you fair warning today, and I call the earth and the sky as witnesses. If you ever make idols, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will be angry, and you won't have long to live, because the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will let you be wiped out. </span> <span class="text Deut-4-27" id="en-CEV-4288"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup> Only a few of you will survive, and the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will force you to leave the land and will scatter you among the nations. </span> <span class="text Deut-4-28" id="en-CEV-4289"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>There you will have to worship gods made of wood and stone, and these are nothing but idols that can't see or hear or eat or smell.</span></p> <p><span class="text Deut-4-29-Deut-4-30" id="en-CEV-4290"><sup class="versenum">29-30 </sup> In all of your troubles, you may finally decide that you want to worship only the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>.

The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will remember his promise, and he will keep the agreement he made with your ancestors.</span></p> <p><span class="text Deut-4-32-Deut-4-34" id="en-CEV-4292"><sup class="versenum">32-34 </sup>When the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> your God brought you out of Egypt, you saw how he fought for you and showed his great power by performing terrifying miracles. You became his people, and at Mount Sinai you heard him talking to you out of fiery flames. And yet you are still alive! Has anything like this ever happened since the time God created humans? No matter where you go or who you ask, you will get the same answer. No one has ever heard of another god even trying to do such things as the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> your God has done for you.</span></p> <p><span class="text Deut-4-35-Deut-4-36" id="en-CEV-4293"><sup class="versenum">35-36 </sup> The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> wants you to know he is the only true God, and he wants you to obey him.

So the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> used his great power to bring you out of Egypt. </span> <span class="text Deut-4-38" id="en-CEV-4295"><sup class="versenum">38 </sup>Now you face other nations more powerful than you are, but the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has already started forcing them out of their land and giving it to you.</span></p> <p><span class="text Deut-4-39" id="en-CEV-4296"><sup class="versenum">39 </sup>So remember that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> is the only true God, whether in the sky above or on the earth below. </span> <span class="text Deut-4-40" id="en-CEV-4297"><sup class="versenum">40 </sup>Today I am explaining his laws and teachings.
