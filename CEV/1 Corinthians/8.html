<h3><span class="text 1Cor-8-1" id="en-CEV-26428">Food Offered to Idols</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text 1Cor-8-1"><span class="chapternum">8 </span>In your letter you asked me about food offered to idols. All of us know something about this subject. But knowledge makes us proud of ourselves, while love makes us helpful to others. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-8-2" id="en-CEV-26429"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>In fact, people who think they know so much don't know anything at all. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-8-3" id="en-CEV-26430"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>But God has no doubts about who loves him.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-8-4" id="en-CEV-26431"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Even though food is offered to idols, we know that none of the idols in this world are alive. After all, there is only one God. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-8-5" id="en-CEV-26432"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Many things in heaven and on earth are called gods and lords, but none of them really are gods or lords. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-8-6" id="en-CEV-26433"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>We have only one God, and he is the Father. He created everything, and we live for him. Jesus Christ is our only Lord. Everything was made by him, and by him life was given to us.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-8-7" id="en-CEV-26434"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Not everyone knows these things. In fact, many people have grown up with the belief that idols have life in them. So when they eat meat offered to idols, they are bothered by a weak conscience. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-8-8" id="en-CEV-26435"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>But food doesn't bring us any closer to God. We are no worse off if we don't eat, and we are no better off if we do.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-8-9" id="en-CEV-26436"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Don't cause problems for someone with a weak conscience, just because you have the right to eat anything. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-8-10" id="en-CEV-26437"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>You know all this, and so it doesn't bother you to eat in the temple of an idol. But suppose a person with a weak conscience sees you and decides to eat food that has been offered to idols. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-8-11" id="en-CEV-26438"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Then what you know has destroyed someone Christ died for. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-8-12" id="en-CEV-26439"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>When you sin by hurting a follower with a weak conscience, you sin against Christ. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-8-13" id="en-CEV-26440"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>So if I hurt one of the Lord's followers by what I eat, I will never eat meat as long as I live.</span></p> </div>
