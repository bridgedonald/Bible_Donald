<h3><span class="text 1Cor-6-1" id="en-CEV-26368">Taking Each Other to Court</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text 1Cor-6-1"><span class="chapternum">6 </span>When one of you has a complaint against another, do you take your complaint to a court of sinners? Or do you take it to God's people? </span> <span class="text 1Cor-6-2" id="en-CEV-26369"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Don't you know that God's people will judge the world? And if you are going to judge the world, can't you settle small problems? </span> <span class="text 1Cor-6-3" id="en-CEV-26370"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Don't you know we will judge angels? And if this is so, we can surely judge everyday matters. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-6-4" id="en-CEV-26371"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Why do you take everyday complaints to judges who are not respected by the church? </span> <span class="text 1Cor-6-5" id="en-CEV-26372"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>I say this to your shame. Aren't any of you wise enough to act as a judge between one follower and another? </span> <span class="text 1Cor-6-6" id="en-CEV-26373"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Why should one of you take another to be tried by unbelievers?</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-6-7" id="en-CEV-26374"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>When one of you takes another to court, all of you lose. It would be better to let yourselves be cheated and robbed. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-6-8" id="en-CEV-26375"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>But instead, you cheat and rob other followers.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-6-9" id="en-CEV-26376"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Don't you know that evil people won't have a share in the blessings of God's kingdom? Don't fool yourselves! No one who is immoral or worships idols or is unfaithful in marriage or is a pervert or behaves like a homosexual </span> <span class="text 1Cor-6-10" id="en-CEV-26377"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>will share in God's kingdom. Neither will any thief or greedy person or drunkard or anyone who curses and cheats others. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-6-11" id="en-CEV-26378"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Some of you used to be like that. But now the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and the power of God's Spirit have washed you and made you holy and acceptable to God.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 1Cor-6-12" id="en-CEV-26379">Honor God with Your Body</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Cor-6-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup> Some of you say, “We can do anything we want to.” But I tell you not everything is good for us. So I refuse to let anything have power over me. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-6-13" id="en-CEV-26380"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>You also say, “Food is meant for our bodies, and our bodies are meant for food.” But I tell you that God will destroy them both. We are not supposed to do indecent things with our bodies. We are to use them for the Lord who is in charge of our bodies. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-6-14" id="en-CEV-26381"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>God will raise us from death by the same power he used when he raised our Lord to life.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-6-15" id="en-CEV-26382"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Don't you know that your bodies are part of the body of Christ? Is it right for me to join part of the body of Christ to a prostitute? No, it isn't! </span> <span class="text 1Cor-6-16" id="en-CEV-26383"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup> Don't you know that a man who does that becomes part of her body? The Scriptures say, “The two of them will be like one person.” </span> <span class="text 1Cor-6-17" id="en-CEV-26384"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>But anyone who is joined to the Lord is one in spirit with him.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-6-18" id="en-CEV-26385"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Don't be immoral in matters of sex. That is a sin against your own body in a way no other sin is. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-6-19" id="en-CEV-26386"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup> You surely know that your body is a temple where the Holy Spirit lives. The Spirit is in you and is a gift from God. You are no longer your own. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-6-20" id="en-CEV-26387"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>God paid a great price for you. So use your body to honor God.</span></p>  <!--end of crossrefs-->
