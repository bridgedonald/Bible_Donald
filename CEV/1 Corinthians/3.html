<h3><span class="text 1Cor-3-1" id="en-CEV-26314">Working Together for God</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text 1Cor-3-1"><span class="chapternum">3 </span>My friends, you are acting like the people of this world. That's why I could not speak to you as spiritual people. You are like babies as far as your faith in Christ is concerned. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-3-2" id="en-CEV-26315"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup> So I had to treat you like babies and feed you milk. You could not take solid food, and you still cannot, </span> <span class="text 1Cor-3-3" id="en-CEV-26316"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>because you are not yet spiritual. You are jealous and argue with each other. This proves you are not spiritual and you are acting like the people of this world.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-3-4" id="en-CEV-26317"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup> Some of you say you follow me, and others claim to follow Apollos. Isn't this how ordinary people behave? </span> <span class="text 1Cor-3-5" id="en-CEV-26318"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Apollos and I are merely servants who helped you to have faith. It was the Lord who made it all happen. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-3-6" id="en-CEV-26319"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup> I planted the seeds, Apollos watered them, but God made them sprout and grow. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-3-7" id="en-CEV-26320"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>What matters isn't those who planted or watered, but God who made the plants grow. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-3-8" id="en-CEV-26321"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>The one who plants is just as important as the one who waters. And each one will be paid for what they do. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-3-9" id="en-CEV-26322"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Apollos and I work together for God, and you are God's garden and God's building.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 1Cor-3-10" id="en-CEV-26323">Only One Foundation</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Cor-3-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>God treated me with undeserved grace and let me become an expert builder. I laid a foundation on which others have built. But we must each be careful how we build, </span> <span class="text 1Cor-3-11" id="en-CEV-26324"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>because Christ is the only foundation. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-3-12-1Cor-3-13" id="en-CEV-26325"><sup class="versenum">12-13 </sup>Whatever we build on this foundation will be tested by fire on the day of judgment. Then everyone will find out if we have used gold, silver, and precious stones, or wood, hay, and straw. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-3-14" id="en-CEV-26326"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>We will be rewarded if our building is left standing. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-3-15" id="en-CEV-26327"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>But if it is destroyed by the fire, we will lose everything. Yet we ourselves will be saved, like someone escaping from flames.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-3-16" id="en-CEV-26328"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup> All of you surely know you are God's temple and his Spirit lives in you. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-3-17" id="en-CEV-26329"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Together you are God's holy temple, and God will destroy anyone who destroys his temple.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-3-18" id="en-CEV-26330"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Don't fool yourselves! If any of you think you are wise in the things of this world, you will have to become foolish before you can be truly wise. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-3-19" id="en-CEV-26331"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup> This is because God considers the wisdom of this world to be foolish. It is just as the Scriptures say, “God catches the wise when they try to outsmart him.” </span> <span class="text 1Cor-3-20" id="en-CEV-26332"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup> The Scriptures also say, “The Lord knows that the plans made by wise people are useless.” </span> <span class="text 1Cor-3-21-1Cor-3-22" id="en-CEV-26333"><sup class="versenum">21-22 </sup>So stop bragging about what anyone has done. Paul and Apollos and Peter<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-26333a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-26333a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-26333a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> all belong to you. In fact, everything is yours, including the world, life, death, the present, and the future. Everything belongs to you, </span> <span class="text 1Cor-3-23" id="en-CEV-26334"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
