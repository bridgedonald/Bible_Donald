Yet the same God works in all of us and helps us in everything we do.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-12-7" id="en-CEV-26539"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>The Spirit has given each of us a special way of serving others. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-12-8" id="en-CEV-26540"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Some of us can speak with wisdom, while others can speak with knowledge, but these gifts come from the same Spirit. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-12-9" id="en-CEV-26541"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>To others the Spirit has given great faith or the power to heal the sick </span> <span class="text 1Cor-12-10" id="en-CEV-26542"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>or the power to work mighty miracles. Some of us are prophets, and some of us recognize when God's Spirit is present.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-26542a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-26542a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-26542a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> Others can speak different kinds of languages, and still others can tell what these languages mean. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-12-11" id="en-CEV-26543"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>But it is the Spirit who does all this and decides which gifts to give to each of us.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 1Cor-12-12" id="en-CEV-26544">One Body with Many Parts</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Cor-12-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup> The body of Christ has many different parts, just as any other body does. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-12-13" id="en-CEV-26545"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Some of us are Jews, and others are Gentiles. Some of us are slaves, and others are free. But God's Spirit baptized each of us and made us part of the body of Christ. Now we each drink from that same Spirit.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-26545b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-26545b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-26545b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-12-14" id="en-CEV-26546"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Our bodies don't have just one part. They have many parts. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-12-15" id="en-CEV-26547"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Suppose a foot says, “I'm not a hand, and so I'm not part of the body.” Wouldn't the foot still belong to the body? </span> <span class="text 1Cor-12-16" id="en-CEV-26548"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Or suppose an ear says, “I'm not an eye, and so I'm not part of the body.” Wouldn't the ear still belong to the body? </span> <span class="text 1Cor-12-17" id="en-CEV-26549"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>If our bodies were only an eye, we couldn't hear a thing. And if they were only an ear, we couldn't smell a thing. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-12-18" id="en-CEV-26550"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>But God has put all parts of our body together in the way that he decided is best.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-12-19" id="en-CEV-26551"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>A body isn't really a body, unless there is more than one part. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-12-20" id="en-CEV-26552"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>It takes many parts to make a single body. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-12-21" id="en-CEV-26553"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>That's why the eyes cannot say they don't need the hands. That's also why the head cannot say it doesn't need the feet. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-12-22" id="en-CEV-26554"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>In fact, we cannot get along without the parts of the body that seem to be the weakest. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-12-23" id="en-CEV-26555"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>We take special care to dress up some parts of our bodies. We are modest about our personal parts, </span> <span class="text 1Cor-12-24" id="en-CEV-26556"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>but we don't have to be modest about other parts.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Cor-12-24">God put our bodies together in such a way that even the parts that seem the least important are valuable. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-12-25" id="en-CEV-26557"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>He did this to make all parts of the body work together smoothly, with each part caring about the others. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-12-26" id="en-CEV-26558"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>If one part of our body hurts, we hurt all over. If one part of our body is honored, the whole body will be happy.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-12-27" id="en-CEV-26559"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>Together you are the body of Christ. Each one of you is part of his body. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-12-28" id="en-CEV-26560"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup> First, God chose some people to be apostles and prophets and teachers for the church. But he also chose some to work miracles or heal the sick or help others or be leaders or speak different kinds of languages. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-12-29" id="en-CEV-26561"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>Not everyone is an apostle. Not everyone is a prophet. Not everyone is a teacher.
