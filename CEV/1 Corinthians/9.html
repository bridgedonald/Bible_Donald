<h3><span class="text 1Cor-9-1" id="en-CEV-26441">The Rights of an Apostle</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text 1Cor-9-1"><span class="chapternum">9 </span>I am free. I am an apostle. I have seen the Lord Jesus and have led you to have faith in him. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-9-2" id="en-CEV-26442"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Others may think that I am not an apostle, but you are proof that I am an apostle to you.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-9-3" id="en-CEV-26443"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>When people question me, I tell them </span> <span class="text 1Cor-9-4" id="en-CEV-26444"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>that Barnabas and I have the right to our food and drink. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-9-5" id="en-CEV-26445"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>We each have the right to marry one of the Lord's followers and to take her along with us, just as the other apostles and the Lord's brothers and Peter<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-26445a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-26445a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-26445a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> do. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-9-6" id="en-CEV-26446"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Are we the only ones who have to support ourselves by working at another job? </span> <span class="text 1Cor-9-7" id="en-CEV-26447"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Do soldiers pay their own salaries? Don't people who raise grapes eat some of what they grow? Don't shepherds get milk from their own goats?</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-9-8-1Cor-9-9" id="en-CEV-26448"><sup class="versenum">8-9 </sup> I am not saying this on my own authority. The Law of Moses tells us not to muzzle an ox when it is grinding grain. But was God concerned only about an ox? </span> <span class="text 1Cor-9-10" id="en-CEV-26449"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>No, he wasn't! He was talking about us. This was written in the Scriptures so that all who plow and all who grind the grain will look forward to sharing in the harvest.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-9-11" id="en-CEV-26450"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup> When we told the message to you, it was like planting spiritual seed. So we have the right to accept material things as our harvest from you. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-9-12" id="en-CEV-26451"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>If others have the right to do this, we have an even greater right. But we haven't used this right of ours. We are willing to put up with anything to keep from causing trouble for the message about Christ.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-9-13" id="en-CEV-26452"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup> Don't you know that people who work in the temple make their living from what is brought to the temple? Don't you know that a person who serves at the altar is given part of what is offered? </span> <span class="text 1Cor-9-14" id="en-CEV-26453"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup> In the same way, the Lord wants everyone who preaches the good news to make a living from preaching this message.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-9-15" id="en-CEV-26454"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>But I have never used these privileges of mine, and I am not writing this because I want to start now. I would rather die than have someone rob me of the right to take pride in this. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-9-16" id="en-CEV-26455"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>I don't have any reason to brag about preaching the good news. Preaching is something God told me to do, and if I don't do it, I am doomed. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-9-17" id="en-CEV-26456"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>If I preach because I want to, I will be paid. But even if I don't want to, it is still something God has sent me to do. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-9-18" id="en-CEV-26457"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>What pay am I given? It is the chance to preach the good news free of charge and not to use the privileges that are mine because I am a preacher.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-9-19" id="en-CEV-26458"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>I am not anyone's slave. But I have become a slave to everyone, so I can win as many people as possible. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-9-20" id="en-CEV-26459"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>When I am with the Jews, I live like a Jew to win Jews. They are ruled by the Law of Moses, and I am not. But I live by the Law to win them. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-9-21" id="en-CEV-26460"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>And when I am with people who are not ruled by the Law, I forget about the Law to win them. Of course, I never really forget about the law of God. In fact, I am ruled by the law of Christ. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-9-22" id="en-CEV-26461"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>When I am with people whose faith is weak, I live as they do to win them. I do everything I can to win everyone I possibly can. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-9-23" id="en-CEV-26462"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>I do all this for the good news, because I want to share in its blessings.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 1Cor-9-24" id="en-CEV-26463">A Race and a Fight</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Cor-9-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup> You know that many runners enter a race, and only one of them wins the prize. So run to win! </span> <span class="text 1Cor-9-25" id="en-CEV-26464"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup> Athletes work hard to win a crown that cannot last, but we do it for a crown that will last forever. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-9-26" id="en-CEV-26465"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>I don't run without a goal. And I don't box by beating my fists in the air. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-9-27" id="en-CEV-26466"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>I keep my body under control and make it my slave, so I won't lose out after telling the good news to others.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
