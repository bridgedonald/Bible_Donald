<h3><span class="text 1Cor-7-1" id="en-CEV-26388">Questions about Marriage</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text 1Cor-7-1"><span class="chapternum">7 </span>Now I will answer the questions you asked in your letter. You asked, “Is it best for people not to marry?”<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-26388a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-26388a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-26388a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text 1Cor-7-2" id="en-CEV-26389"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Well, having your own husband or wife should keep you from doing something immoral. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-7-3" id="en-CEV-26390"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Husbands and wives should be fair with each other about having sex. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-7-4" id="en-CEV-26391"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>A wife belongs to her husband instead of to herself, and a husband belongs to his wife instead of to himself. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-7-5" id="en-CEV-26392"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>So don't refuse sex to each other, unless you agree not to have sex for a little while, in order to spend time in prayer. Then Satan won't be able to tempt you because of your lack of self-control. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-7-6" id="en-CEV-26393"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>In my opinion that is what should be done, though I don't know of anything the Lord said about this matter. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-7-7" id="en-CEV-26394"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>I wish all of you were like me, but God has given different gifts to each of us.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-7-8" id="en-CEV-26395"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>My advice for the unmarried and for widows is that it is acceptable for them to remain single, just as I am. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-7-9" id="en-CEV-26396"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>But if you don't have enough self-control, then go ahead and get married. After all, it is better to marry than to burn with desire.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-26396b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-26396b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-26396b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-7-10" id="en-CEV-26397"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup> I instruct married couples to stay together, and this is exactly what the Lord himself taught. A wife who leaves her husband </span> <span class="text 1Cor-7-11" id="en-CEV-26398"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>should either stay single or go back to her husband. And a husband should not leave his wife.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-7-12" id="en-CEV-26399"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>I don't know of anything else the Lord said about marriage. All I can do is to give you my own advice. If your wife isn't a follower of the Lord, but is willing to stay with you, don't divorce her. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-7-13" id="en-CEV-26400"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>If your husband isn't a follower, but is willing to stay with you, don't divorce him. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-7-14" id="en-CEV-26401"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Your husband or wife who isn't a follower is made holy by having you as a partner. This also makes your children holy and keeps them from being unclean in God's sight.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-7-15" id="en-CEV-26402"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>If your husband or wife isn't a follower of the Lord and decides to divorce you, then you should agree to it. You are no longer bound to that person. After all, God chose you and wants you to live at peace. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-7-16" id="en-CEV-26403"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>And besides, how do you know if you will be able to save your husband or wife who isn't a follower?</span></p> <h3><span class="text 1Cor-7-17" id="en-CEV-26404">Obeying the Lord at All Times</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Cor-7-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>In every church I tell the people to stay as they were when the Lord Jesus chose them and God called them to be his own. Now I say the same thing to you. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-7-18" id="en-CEV-26405"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup> If you are already circumcised, don't try to change it. If you are not circumcised, don't get circumcised. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-7-19" id="en-CEV-26406"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Being circumcised or uncircumcised isn't really what matters. The important thing is to obey God's commands. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-7-20" id="en-CEV-26407"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>So don't try to change what you were when God chose you. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-7-21" id="en-CEV-26408"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Are you a slave? Don't let that bother you. But if you can win your freedom, you should. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-7-22" id="en-CEV-26409"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>When the Lord chooses slaves, they become his free people. And when he chooses free people, they become slaves of Christ. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-7-23" id="en-CEV-26410"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>God paid a great price for you. So don't become slaves of anyone else. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-7-24" id="en-CEV-26411"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>Stay what you were when God chose you.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 1Cor-7-25" id="en-CEV-26412">Unmarried People</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Cor-7-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>I don't know of anything the Lord said about people who have never been married.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-26412c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-26412c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-26412c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> But I will tell you what I think. And you can trust me, because the Lord has treated me with kindness. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-7-26" id="en-CEV-26413"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>We are now going through hard times, and I think it is best for you to stay as you are. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-7-27" id="en-CEV-26414"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>If you are married, stay married. If you are not married, don't try to get married. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-7-28" id="en-CEV-26415"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>It isn't wrong to marry, even if you have never been married before. But those who marry will have a lot of trouble, and I want to protect you from this.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-7-29" id="en-CEV-26416"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>My friends, what I mean is that the Lord will soon come,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-26416d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-26416d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-26416d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> and it won't matter if you are married or not. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-7-30" id="en-CEV-26417"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>It will be all the same if you are crying or laughing, or if you are buying or are completely broke. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-7-31" id="en-CEV-26418"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>It won't make any difference how much good you are getting from this world or how much you like it.

An unmarried man worries about how to please the Lord. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-7-33" id="en-CEV-26420"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>But a married man has more worries. He must worry about the things of this world, because he wants to please his wife. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-7-34" id="en-CEV-26421"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>So he is pulled in two directions.

But a married woman worries about the things of this world, because she wants to please her husband. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-7-35" id="en-CEV-26422"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>What I am saying is for your own good—it isn't to limit your freedom. I want to help you to live right and to love the Lord above all else.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-7-36" id="en-CEV-26423"><sup class="versenum">36 </sup>But suppose you are engaged to someone old enough to be married, and you want her so much that all you can think about is getting married.
