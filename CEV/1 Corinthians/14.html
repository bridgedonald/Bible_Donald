<h3><span class="text 1Cor-14-1" id="en-CEV-26577">Speaking Unknown Languages and Prophesying</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text 1Cor-14-1"><span class="chapternum">14 </span>Love should be your guide. Be eager to have the gifts that come from the Holy Spirit, especially the gift of prophecy. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-14-2" id="en-CEV-26578"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>If you speak languages that others don't know, God will understand what you are saying, though no one else will know what you mean. You will be talking about mysteries that only the Spirit understands. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-14-3" id="en-CEV-26579"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>But when you prophesy, you will be understood, and others will be helped. They will be encouraged and made to feel better.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-14-4" id="en-CEV-26580"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>By speaking languages that others don't know, you help only yourself. But by prophesying you help everyone in the church. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-14-5" id="en-CEV-26581"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>I am glad for you to speak unknown languages, although I prefer that you would prophesy. In fact, prophesying does much more good than speaking unknown languages, unless someone can help the church by explaining what you mean.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-14-6" id="en-CEV-26582"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>My friends, what good would it do, if I came and spoke unknown languages to you and didn't explain what I meant? How would I help you, unless I told you what God had shown me or gave you some knowledge or prophecy or teaching? </span> <span class="text 1Cor-14-7" id="en-CEV-26583"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>If all musical instruments sounded alike, how would you know the difference between a flute and a harp? </span> <span class="text 1Cor-14-8" id="en-CEV-26584"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>If a bugle call isn't clear, how would you know to get ready for battle?</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-14-9" id="en-CEV-26585"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>This is how it is when you speak unknown languages. If no one can understand what you are talking about, you will only be talking to the wind. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-14-10" id="en-CEV-26586"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>There are many different languages in this world, and all of them make sense. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-14-11" id="en-CEV-26587"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>But if I don't understand the language that someone is using, we will be like foreigners to each other. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-14-12" id="en-CEV-26588"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>If you really want spiritual gifts, choose the ones that will be most helpful to the church.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-14-13" id="en-CEV-26589"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>When we speak languages that others don't know, we should pray for the power to explain what we mean. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-14-14" id="en-CEV-26590"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>For example, if I use an unknown language in my prayers, my spirit prays but my mind is useless. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-14-15" id="en-CEV-26591"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Then what should I do? There are times when I should pray with my spirit, and times when I should pray with my mind. Sometimes I should sing with my spirit, and at other times I should sing with my mind.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-14-16" id="en-CEV-26592"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Suppose some strangers are in your worship service, when you are praising God with your spirit. If they don't understand you, how will they know to say, “Amen”? </span> <span class="text 1Cor-14-17" id="en-CEV-26593"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>You may be worshiping God in a wonderful way, but no one else will be helped. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-14-18" id="en-CEV-26594"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>I thank God that I speak unknown languages more than any of you. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-14-19" id="en-CEV-26595"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>But words that make sense can help the church. This is why in church I would rather speak five words that make sense than to speak 10,000 words in a language that others don't know.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-14-20" id="en-CEV-26596"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>My friends, stop thinking like children. Think like mature people and be as innocent as tiny babies. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-14-21" id="en-CEV-26597"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup> In the Scriptures the Lord says,</span></p><div class="poetry"><p class="line"><span class="text 1Cor-14-21">“I will use strangers</span><br/><span class="text 1Cor-14-21">who speak unknown languages</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text 1Cor-14-21">to talk to my people.</span></span><br/><span class="text 1Cor-14-21">They will speak to them</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text 1Cor-14-21">in foreign languages,</span></span><br/><span class="text 1Cor-14-21">but still my people</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text 1Cor-14-21">won't listen to me.”</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1"><span class="text 1Cor-14-22" id="en-CEV-26598"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Languages others don't know may mean something to unbelievers, but not to the Lord's followers. Prophecy, on the other hand, is for followers, not for unbelievers. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-14-23" id="en-CEV-26599"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>Suppose everyone in your worship service started speaking unknown languages, and some outsiders or some unbelievers come in. Won't they think you are crazy? </span> <span class="text 1Cor-14-24" id="en-CEV-26600"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>But suppose all of you are prophesying when those unbelievers and outsiders come in. They will realize that they are sinners, and they will want to change their ways because of what you are saying. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-14-25" id="en-CEV-26601"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>They will tell what is hidden in their hearts. Then they will kneel down and say to God, “We are certain that you are with these people.”</span></p> <h3><span class="text 1Cor-14-26" id="en-CEV-26602">Worship Must Be Orderly</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Cor-14-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>My friends, when you meet to worship, you must do everything for the good of everyone there. That's how it should be when someone sings or teaches or tells what God has said or speaks an unknown language or explains what the language means. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-14-27" id="en-CEV-26603"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>No more than two or three of you should speak unknown languages during the meeting. You must take turns, and someone should always be there to explain what you mean. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-14-28" id="en-CEV-26604"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>If no one can explain, you must keep silent in church and speak only to yourself and to God.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-14-29" id="en-CEV-26605"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>Two or three persons may prophesy, and everyone else must listen carefully. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-14-30" id="en-CEV-26606"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>If someone sitting there receives a message from God, the speaker must stop and let the other person speak. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-14-31" id="en-CEV-26607"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>Let only one person speak at a time, then all of you will learn something and be encouraged. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-14-32" id="en-CEV-26608"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>A prophet should be willing to stop and let someone else speak. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-14-33" id="en-CEV-26609"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>God wants everything to be done peacefully and in order.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Cor-14-33">When God's people meet in church, </span> <span class="text 1Cor-14-34" id="en-CEV-26610"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>the women must not be allowed to speak. They must keep quiet and listen, as the Law of Moses teaches. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-14-35" id="en-CEV-26611"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>If there is something they want to know, they can ask their husbands when they get home. It is disgraceful for women to speak in church.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-14-36" id="en-CEV-26612"><sup class="versenum">36 </sup>God's message did not start with you people, and you are not the only ones it has reached.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Cor-14-37" id="en-CEV-26613"><sup class="versenum">37 </sup>If you think of yourself as a prophet or a spiritual person, you will know I am writing only what the Lord has commanded. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-14-38" id="en-CEV-26614"><sup class="versenum">38 </sup>So don't pay attention to anyone who ignores what I am writing. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-14-39" id="en-CEV-26615"><sup class="versenum">39 </sup>My friends, be eager to prophesy and don't stop anyone from speaking languages that others don't know. </span> <span class="text 1Cor-14-40" id="en-CEV-26616"><sup class="versenum">40 </sup>But do everything properly and in order.</span></p>  <!--end of crossrefs-->
