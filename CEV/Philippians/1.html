<p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Phil-1-1" id="en-CEV-27251"><span class="chapternum">1 </span> From Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus.</span></p><p><span class="text Phil-1-1">To all God's people who belong to Christ Jesus at Philippi and to all your bishops and deacons.</span></p> <p><span class="text Phil-1-2" id="en-CEV-27252"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>I pray that God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you and will bless you with peace!</span></p> <h3><span class="text Phil-1-3" id="en-CEV-27253">Paul's Prayer for the Church in Philippi</span></h3><p><span class="text Phil-1-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Every time I think of you, I thank my God. </span> <span class="text Phil-1-4" id="en-CEV-27254"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>And whenever I mention you in my prayers, it makes me happy. </span> <span class="text Phil-1-5" id="en-CEV-27255"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>This is because you have taken part with me in spreading the good news from the first day you heard about it. </span> <span class="text Phil-1-6" id="en-CEV-27256"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>God is the one who began this good work in you, and I am certain that he won't stop before it is complete on the day that Christ Jesus returns.</span></p> <p><span class="text Phil-1-7" id="en-CEV-27257"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>You have a special place in my heart. So it is only natural for me to feel the way I do. All of you have helped in the work God has given me, as I defend the good news and tell about it here in jail. </span> <span class="text Phil-1-8" id="en-CEV-27258"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>God himself knows how much I want to see you. He knows I care for you in the same way Christ Jesus does.</span></p> <p><span class="text Phil-1-9" id="en-CEV-27259"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>I pray that your love will keep on growing and you will fully know and understand </span> <span class="text Phil-1-10" id="en-CEV-27260"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>how to make the right choices. Then you will still be pure and innocent when Christ returns. And until that day, </span> <span class="text Phil-1-11" id="en-CEV-27261"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Jesus Christ will keep you busy doing good deeds that bring glory and praise to God.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Phil-1-12" id="en-CEV-27262">What Life Means to Paul</span></h3><p><span class="text Phil-1-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>My dear friends, I want you to know that what has happened to me has helped to spread the good news. </span> <span class="text Phil-1-13" id="en-CEV-27263"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup> The Roman guards and all the others know I am here in jail because I serve Christ. </span> <span class="text Phil-1-14" id="en-CEV-27264"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Now most of the Lord's followers have become brave and are fearlessly telling the message.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27264a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27264a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27264a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text Phil-1-15" id="en-CEV-27265"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Some are preaching about Christ because they are jealous and envious of us. Others are preaching because they want to help. </span> <span class="text Phil-1-16" id="en-CEV-27266"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>They love Christ and know I am here to defend the good news about him. </span> <span class="text Phil-1-17" id="en-CEV-27267"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>But the ones who are jealous of us are not sincere. They just want to cause trouble for me while I am in jail. </span> <span class="text Phil-1-18" id="en-CEV-27268"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>But that doesn't matter. All that matters is that people are telling about Christ, whether they are sincere or not. This is what makes me glad.</span></p><p><span class="text Phil-1-18">I will keep on being glad, </span> <span class="text Phil-1-19" id="en-CEV-27269"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>because I know that your prayers and the help that comes from the Spirit of Christ Jesus will keep me safe. </span> <span class="text Phil-1-20" id="en-CEV-27270"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>I honestly expect and hope I will never do anything to be ashamed of. Whether I live or die, I always want to be as brave as I am now and bring honor to Christ.</span></p> <p><span class="text Phil-1-21" id="en-CEV-27271"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>If I live, it will be for Christ, and if I die, I will gain even more. </span> <span class="text Phil-1-22" id="en-CEV-27272"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>I don't know what to choose. I could keep on living and doing something useful. </span> <span class="text Phil-1-23" id="en-CEV-27273"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>It is a hard choice to make. I want to die and be with Christ, because this would be much better. </span> <span class="text Phil-1-24-Phil-1-25" id="en-CEV-27274"><sup class="versenum">24-25 </sup>But I know that all of you still need me. This is why I am sure I will stay on to help you grow and be happy in your faith. </span> <span class="text Phil-1-26" id="en-CEV-27275"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>Then, when I visit you again, you will have good reason to take great pride in Christ Jesus because of me.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27275b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27275b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27275b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text Phil-1-27" id="en-CEV-27276"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>Above all else, you must live in a way that brings honor to the good news about Christ. Then, whether I visit you or not, I will hear that all of you think alike. I will know that you are working together and are struggling side by side to get others to believe the good news.</span></p> <p><span class="text Phil-1-28" id="en-CEV-27277"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>Be brave when you face your enemies. Your courage will show them that they are going to be destroyed, and it will show you that you will be saved. God will make all of this happen, </span> <span class="text Phil-1-29" id="en-CEV-27278"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>and he has blessed you. Not only do you have faith in Christ, but you suffer for him. </span> <span class="text Phil-1-30" id="en-CEV-27279"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup> You saw me suffer, and you still hear about my troubles. Now you must suffer in the same way.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
