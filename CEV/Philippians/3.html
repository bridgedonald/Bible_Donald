<h3><span class="text Phil-3-1" id="en-CEV-27310">Being Acceptable to God</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Phil-3-1"><span class="chapternum">3 </span>Finally, my dear friends, be glad that you belong to the Lord. It doesn't bother me to write the same things to you that I have written before. In fact, it is for your own good.</span></p> <p><span class="text Phil-3-2" id="en-CEV-27311"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Watch out for those people who behave like dogs! They are evil and want to do more than just circumcise you. </span> <span class="text Phil-3-3" id="en-CEV-27312"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>But we are the ones who are truly circumcised, because we worship by the power of God's Spirit<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27312a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27312a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27312a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> and take pride in Christ Jesus. We don't brag about what we have done, </span> <span class="text Phil-3-4" id="en-CEV-27313"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>although I could. Others may brag about themselves, but I have more reason to brag than anyone else. </span> <span class="text Phil-3-5" id="en-CEV-27314"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup> I was circumcised when I was eight days old,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27314b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27314b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27314b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> and I am from the nation of Israel and the tribe of Benjamin. I am a true Hebrew. As a Pharisee, I strictly obeyed the Law of Moses. </span> <span class="text Phil-3-6" id="en-CEV-27315"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup> And I was so eager I even made trouble for the church. I did everything the Law demands in order to please God.</span></p> <p><span class="text Phil-3-7" id="en-CEV-27316"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>But Christ has shown me that what I once thought was valuable is worthless. </span> <span class="text Phil-3-8" id="en-CEV-27317"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Nothing is as wonderful as knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. I have given up everything else and count it all as garbage. All I want is Christ </span> <span class="text Phil-3-9" id="en-CEV-27318"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>and to know that I belong to him. I could not make myself acceptable to God by obeying the Law of Moses. God accepted me simply because of my faith in Christ. </span> <span class="text Phil-3-10" id="en-CEV-27319"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>All I want is to know Christ and the power that raised him to life. I want to suffer and die as he did, </span> <span class="text Phil-3-11" id="en-CEV-27320"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>so that somehow I also may be raised to life.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Phil-3-12" id="en-CEV-27321">Running toward the Goal</span></h3><p><span class="text Phil-3-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>I have not yet reached my goal, and I am not perfect. But Christ has taken hold of me. So I keep on running and struggling to take hold of the prize. </span> <span class="text Phil-3-13" id="en-CEV-27322"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>My friends, I don't feel I have already arrived. But I forget what is behind, and I struggle for what is ahead. </span> <span class="text Phil-3-14" id="en-CEV-27323"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>I run toward the goal, so I can win the prize of being called to heaven. This is the prize God offers because of what Christ Jesus has done. </span> <span class="text Phil-3-15" id="en-CEV-27324"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>All of us who are mature should think in this same way. And if any of you think differently, God will make it clear to you. </span> <span class="text Phil-3-16" id="en-CEV-27325"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>But we must keep going in the direction that we are now headed.</span></p> <p><span class="text Phil-3-17" id="en-CEV-27326"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup> My friends, I want you to follow my example and learn from others who closely follow the example we set for you. </span> <span class="text Phil-3-18" id="en-CEV-27327"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>I often warned you that many people are living as enemies of the cross of Christ. And now with tears in my eyes, I warn you again </span> <span class="text Phil-3-19" id="en-CEV-27328"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>that they are headed for hell! They worship their stomachs and brag about the disgusting things they do. All they can think about are the things of this world.</span></p> <p><span class="text Phil-3-20" id="en-CEV-27329"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>But we are citizens of heaven and are eagerly waiting for our Savior to come from there. Our Lord Jesus Christ </span> <span class="text Phil-3-21" id="en-CEV-27330"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup> has power over everything, and he will make these poor bodies of ours like his own glorious body.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
