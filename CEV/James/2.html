<h3><span class="text Jas-2-1" id="en-CEV-28175">Warning against Having Favorites</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Jas-2-1"><span class="chapternum">2 </span>My friends, if you have faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, you won't treat some people better than others. </span> <span class="text Jas-2-2" id="en-CEV-28176"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Suppose a rich person wearing fancy clothes and a gold ring comes to one of your meetings. And suppose a poor person dressed in worn-out clothes also comes. </span> <span class="text Jas-2-3" id="en-CEV-28177"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>You must not give the best seat to the one in fancy clothes and tell the one who is poor to stand at the side or sit on the floor. </span> <span class="text Jas-2-4" id="en-CEV-28178"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>This is the same as saying that some people are better than others, and you would be acting like a crooked judge.</span></p> <p><span class="text Jas-2-5" id="en-CEV-28179"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>My dear friends, pay attention. God has given a lot of faith to the poor people in this world. God has also promised them a share in his kingdom that he will give to everyone who loves him. </span> <span class="text Jas-2-6" id="en-CEV-28180"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>You mistreat the poor. But isn't it the rich who boss you around and drag you off to court? </span> <span class="text Jas-2-7" id="en-CEV-28181"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Aren't they the ones who make fun of your Lord?</span></p> <p><span class="text Jas-2-8" id="en-CEV-28182"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup> You will do all right, if you obey the most important law<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28182a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28182a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28182a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> in the Scriptures. It is the law that commands us to love others as much as we love ourselves. </span> <span class="text Jas-2-9" id="en-CEV-28183"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>But if you treat some people better than others, you have done wrong, and the Scriptures teach that you have sinned.</span></p> <p><span class="text Jas-2-10" id="en-CEV-28184"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup> If you obey every law except one, you are still guilty of breaking them all. </span> <span class="text Jas-2-11" id="en-CEV-28185"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup> The same God who told us to be faithful in marriage also told us not to murder. So even if you are faithful in marriage, but murder someone, you still have broken God's Law.</span></p> <p><span class="text Jas-2-12" id="en-CEV-28186"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Speak and act like people who will be judged by the law that sets us free. </span> <span class="text Jas-2-13" id="en-CEV-28187"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Do this, because on the day of judgment there will be no pity for those who have not had pity on others. But even in judgment, God is merciful!<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28187b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28187b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28187b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup></span></p> <h3><span class="text Jas-2-14" id="en-CEV-28188">Faith and Works</span></h3><p><span class="text Jas-2-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>My friends, what good is it to say you have faith, when you don't do anything to show you really do have faith? Can this kind of faith save you? </span> <span class="text Jas-2-15" id="en-CEV-28189"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>If you know someone who doesn't have any clothes or food, </span> <span class="text Jas-2-16" id="en-CEV-28190"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>you shouldn't just say, “I hope all goes well for you. I hope you will be warm and have plenty to eat.” What good is it to say this, unless you do something to help? </span> <span class="text Jas-2-17" id="en-CEV-28191"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Faith that doesn't lead us to do good deeds is all alone and dead!</span></p> <p><span class="text Jas-2-18" id="en-CEV-28192"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Suppose someone disagrees and says, “It is possible to have faith without doing kind deeds.”</span></p><p><span class="text Jas-2-18">I would answer, “Prove that you have faith without doing kind deeds, and I will prove that I have faith by doing them.” </span> <span class="text Jas-2-19" id="en-CEV-28193"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>You surely believe there is only one God. That's fine. Even demons believe this, and it makes them shake with fear.</span></p> <p><span class="text Jas-2-20" id="en-CEV-28194"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Does some stupid person want proof that faith without deeds is useless? </span> <span class="text Jas-2-21" id="en-CEV-28195"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup> Well, our ancestor Abraham pleased God by putting his son Isaac on the altar to sacrifice him. </span> <span class="text Jas-2-22" id="en-CEV-28196"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Now you see how Abraham's faith and deeds worked together. He proved his faith was real by what he did. </span> <span class="text Jas-2-23" id="en-CEV-28197"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup> This is what the Scriptures mean by saying, “Abraham had faith in God, and God accepted him.” That's how Abraham became God's friend.</span></p> <p><span class="text Jas-2-24" id="en-CEV-28198"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>You can now see that we please God by what we do and not only by what we believe. </span> <span class="text Jas-2-25" id="en-CEV-28199"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup> For example, Rahab had been a prostitute. But she pleased God when she welcomed the spies and sent them home by another way.</span></p> <p><span class="text Jas-2-26" id="en-CEV-28200"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>Anyone who doesn't breathe is dead, and faith that doesn't do anything is just as dead!</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
