<h3><span class="text Jas-3-1" id="en-CEV-28201">The Tongue</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Jas-3-1"><span class="chapternum">3 </span>My friends, we should not all try to become teachers. In fact, teachers will be judged more strictly than others. </span> <span class="text Jas-3-2" id="en-CEV-28202"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup> All of us do many wrong things. But if you can control your tongue, you are mature and able to control your whole body.</span></p> <p><span class="text Jas-3-3" id="en-CEV-28203"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>By putting a bit into the mouth of a horse, we can turn the horse in different directions. </span> <span class="text Jas-3-4" id="en-CEV-28204"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>It takes strong winds to move a large sailing ship, but the captain uses only a small rudder to make it go in any direction. </span> <span class="text Jas-3-5" id="en-CEV-28205"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Our tongues are small too, and yet they brag about big things.</span></p><p><span class="text Jas-3-5">It takes only a spark to start a forest fire! </span> <span class="text Jas-3-6" id="en-CEV-28206"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup> The tongue is like a spark. It is an evil power that dirties the rest of the body and sets a person's entire life on fire with flames that come from hell itself. </span> <span class="text Jas-3-7" id="en-CEV-28207"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles, and sea creatures can be tamed and have been tamed. </span> <span class="text Jas-3-8" id="en-CEV-28208"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>But our tongues get out of control. They are restless and evil, and always spreading deadly poison.</span></p> <p><span class="text Jas-3-9-Jas-3-10" id="en-CEV-28209"><sup class="versenum">9-10 </sup> My dear friends, with our tongues we speak both praises and curses. We praise our Lord and Father, and we curse people who were created to be like God, and this isn't right. </span> <span class="text Jas-3-11" id="en-CEV-28210"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Can clean water and dirty water both flow from the same spring? </span> <span class="text Jas-3-12" id="en-CEV-28211"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Can a fig tree produce olives or a grapevine produce figs?

Then show it by living right and by being humble and wise in everything you do. </span> <span class="text Jas-3-14" id="en-CEV-28213"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>But if your heart is full of bitter jealousy and selfishness, don't brag or lie to cover up the truth. </span> <span class="text Jas-3-15" id="en-CEV-28214"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>This kind of wisdom doesn't come from above. It is earthly and selfish and comes from the devil himself. </span> <span class="text Jas-3-16" id="en-CEV-28215"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Whenever people are jealous or selfish, they cause trouble and do all sorts of cruel things. </span> <span class="text Jas-3-17" id="en-CEV-28216"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>But the wisdom that comes from above leads us to be pure, friendly, gentle, sensible, kind, helpful, genuine, and sincere. </span> <span class="text Jas-3-18" id="en-CEV-28217"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>When peacemakers plant seeds of peace, they will harvest justice.</span></p>  <!--end of crossrefs-->
