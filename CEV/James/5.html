<h3><span class="text Jas-5-1" id="en-CEV-28235">Warning to the Rich</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Jas-5-1"><span class="chapternum">5 </span>You rich people should cry and weep! Terrible things are going to happen to you. </span> <span class="text Jas-5-2" id="en-CEV-28236"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup> Your treasures have already rotted, and moths have eaten your clothes. </span> <span class="text Jas-5-3" id="en-CEV-28237"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup> Your money has rusted, and the rust will be evidence against you, as it burns your body like fire. Yet you keep on storing up wealth in these last days. </span> <span class="text Jas-5-4" id="en-CEV-28238"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup> You refused to pay the people who worked in your fields, and now their unpaid wages are shouting out against you. The Lord All-Powerful has surely heard the cries of the workers who harvested your crops.</span></p> <p><span class="text Jas-5-5" id="en-CEV-28239"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>While here on earth, you have thought only of filling your own stomachs and having a good time. But now you are like fat cattle on their way to be butchered. </span> <span class="text Jas-5-6" id="en-CEV-28240"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup> You have condemned and murdered innocent people, who couldn't even fight back.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Jas-5-7" id="en-CEV-28241">Be Patient and Kind</span></h3><p><span class="text Jas-5-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>My friends, be patient until the Lord returns. Think of farmers who wait patiently for the autumn and spring rains to make their valuable crops grow. </span> <span class="text Jas-5-8" id="en-CEV-28242"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Be patient like those farmers and don't give up. The Lord will soon be here! </span> <span class="text Jas-5-9" id="en-CEV-28243"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Don't grumble about each other or you will be judged, and the judge is right outside the door.</span></p> <p><span class="text Jas-5-10" id="en-CEV-28244"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>My friends, follow the example of the prophets who spoke for the Lord. They were patient, even when they had to suffer. </span> <span class="text Jas-5-11" id="en-CEV-28245"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup> In fact, we praise the ones who endured the most. You remember how patient Job was and how the Lord finally helped him. The Lord did this because he is so merciful and kind.</span></p> <p><span class="text Jas-5-12" id="en-CEV-28246"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup> My friends, above all else, don't take an oath. You must not swear by heaven or by earth or by anything else. “Yes” or “No” is all you need to say. If you say anything more, you will be condemned.</span></p> <p><span class="text Jas-5-13" id="en-CEV-28247"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>If you are having trouble, you should pray. And if you are feeling good, you should sing praises. </span> <span class="text Jas-5-14" id="en-CEV-28248"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup> If you are sick, ask the church leaders<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28248a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28248a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28248a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> to come and pray for you. Ask them to put olive oil<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28248b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28248b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28248b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> on you in the name of the Lord. </span> <span class="text Jas-5-15" id="en-CEV-28249"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>If you have faith when you pray for sick people, they will get well. The Lord will heal them, and if they have sinned, he will forgive them.</span></p> <p><span class="text Jas-5-16" id="en-CEV-28250"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup> If you have sinned, you should tell each other what you have done. Then you can pray for one another and be healed. The prayer of an innocent person is powerful, and it can help a lot. </span> <span class="text Jas-5-17" id="en-CEV-28251"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup> Elijah was just as human as we are, and for three and a half years his prayers kept the rain from falling. </span> <span class="text Jas-5-18" id="en-CEV-28252"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup> But when he did pray for rain, it fell from the skies and made the crops grow.</span></p> <p><span class="text Jas-5-19" id="en-CEV-28253"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>My friends, if any followers have wandered away from the truth, you should try to lead them back. </span> <span class="text Jas-5-20" id="en-CEV-28254"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup> If you turn sinners from the wrong way, you will save them from death, and many of their sins will be forgiven.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
