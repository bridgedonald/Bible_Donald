<p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Jas-1-1" id="en-CEV-28149"><span class="chapternum">1 </span> From James, a servant of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p><p><span class="text Jas-1-1">Greetings to the twelve tribes scattered all over the world.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28149a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28149a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28149a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></span></p> <h3><span class="text Jas-1-2" id="en-CEV-28150">Faith and Wisdom</span></h3><p><span class="text Jas-1-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup> My friends, be glad, even if you have a lot of trouble. </span> <span class="text Jas-1-3" id="en-CEV-28151"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>You know you learn to endure by having your faith tested. </span> <span class="text Jas-1-4" id="en-CEV-28152"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>But you must learn to endure everything, so you will be completely mature and not lacking in anything.</span></p> <p><span class="text Jas-1-5" id="en-CEV-28153"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup> If any of you need wisdom, you should ask God, and it will be given to you. God is generous and won't correct you for asking. </span> <span class="text Jas-1-6" id="en-CEV-28154"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>But when you ask for something, you must have faith and not doubt. Anyone who doubts is like an ocean wave tossed around in a storm. </span> <span class="text Jas-1-7-Jas-1-8" id="en-CEV-28155"><sup class="versenum">7-8 </sup>If you are that kind of person, you can't make up your mind, and you surely can't be trusted. So don't expect the Lord to give you anything at all.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Jas-1-9" id="en-CEV-28156">Poor People and Rich People</span></h3><p><span class="text Jas-1-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Any of God's people who are poor should be glad he thinks so highly of them. </span> <span class="text Jas-1-10" id="en-CEV-28157"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup> But any who are rich should be glad when God makes them humble. Rich people will disappear like wild flowers </span> <span class="text Jas-1-11" id="en-CEV-28158"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>scorched by the burning heat of the sun. The flowers lose their blossoms, and their beauty is destroyed. This is how the rich will disappear, as they go about their business.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Jas-1-12" id="en-CEV-28159">Trials and Temptations</span></h3><p><span class="text Jas-1-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup> God will bless you, if you don't give up when your faith is being tested. He will reward you with a glorious life,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28159b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28159b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28159b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> just as he rewards everyone who loves him.</span></p> <p><span class="text Jas-1-13" id="en-CEV-28160"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup> Don't blame God when you are tempted! God cannot be tempted by evil, and he doesn't use evil to tempt others. </span> <span class="text Jas-1-14" id="en-CEV-28161"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>We are tempted by our own desires that drag us off and trap us. </span> <span class="text Jas-1-15" id="en-CEV-28162"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Our desires make us sin, and when sin is finished with us, it leaves us dead.</span></p> <p><span class="text Jas-1-16" id="en-CEV-28163"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Don't be fooled, my dear friends. </span> <span class="text Jas-1-17" id="en-CEV-28164"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Every good and perfect gift comes down from the Father who created all the lights in the heavens. He is always the same and never makes dark shadows by changing. </span> <span class="text Jas-1-18" id="en-CEV-28165"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>He wanted us to be his own special people,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28165c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28165c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28165c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> and so he sent the true message to give us new birth.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Jas-1-19" id="en-CEV-28166">Hearing and Obeying</span></h3><p><span class="text Jas-1-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup> My dear friends, you should be quick to listen and slow to speak or to get angry. </span> <span class="text Jas-1-20" id="en-CEV-28167"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>If you are angry, you cannot do any of the good things God wants done. </span> <span class="text Jas-1-21" id="en-CEV-28168"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>You must stop doing anything immoral or evil. Instead be humble and accept the message planted in you to save you.</span></p> <p><span class="text Jas-1-22" id="en-CEV-28169"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Obey God's message! Don't fool yourselves by just listening to it. </span> <span class="text Jas-1-23" id="en-CEV-28170"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>If you hear the message and don't obey it, you are like people who stare at themselves in a mirror </span> <span class="text Jas-1-24" id="en-CEV-28171"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>and forget what they look like as soon as they leave. </span> <span class="text Jas-1-25" id="en-CEV-28172"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>But you must never stop looking at the perfect law that sets you free. God will bless you in everything you do, if you listen and obey, and don't just hear and forget.</span></p> <p><span class="text Jas-1-26" id="en-CEV-28173"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>If you think you are being religious, but can't control your tongue, you are fooling yourself, and your religion is useless. </span> <span class="text Jas-1-27" id="en-CEV-28174"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>Religion that pleases God the Father must be pure and spotless. You must help needy orphans and widows and not let this world make you evil.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
