<h3><span class="text Jas-4-1" id="en-CEV-28218">Friendship with the World</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Jas-4-1"><span class="chapternum">4 </span>Why do you fight and argue with each other? Isn't it because you are full of selfish desires that fight to control your body? </span> <span class="text Jas-4-2" id="en-CEV-28219"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>You want something you don't have, and you will do anything to get it. You will even kill! But you still cannot get what you want, and you won't get it by fighting and arguing. You should pray for it. </span> <span class="text Jas-4-3" id="en-CEV-28220"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Yet even when you do pray, your prayers are not answered, because you pray just for selfish reasons.</span></p> <p><span class="text Jas-4-4" id="en-CEV-28221"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>You people aren't faithful to God! Don't you know if you love the world, you are God's enemies? And if you decide to be a friend of the world, you make yourself an enemy of God. </span> <span class="text Jas-4-5" id="en-CEV-28222"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Do you doubt the Scriptures that say, “God truly cares about the Spirit he has put in us”?<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28222a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28222a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28222a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Jas-4-6" id="en-CEV-28223"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup> In fact, God treats us with even greater kindness, just as the Scriptures say,</span></p><div class="poetry"><p class="line"><span class="text Jas-4-6">“God opposes everyone</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Jas-4-6">who is proud,</span></span><br/><span class="text Jas-4-6">but he blesses all who are humble</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Jas-4-6">with undeserved grace.”</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1"><span class="text Jas-4-7" id="en-CEV-28224"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Surrender to God! Resist the devil, and he will run from you. </span> <span class="text Jas-4-8" id="en-CEV-28225"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Come near to God, and he will come near to you. Clean up your lives, you sinners. Purify your hearts, you people who can't make up your mind. </span> <span class="text Jas-4-9" id="en-CEV-28226"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Be sad and sorry and weep. Stop laughing and start crying. Be gloomy instead of glad. </span> <span class="text Jas-4-10" id="en-CEV-28227"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Be humble in the Lord's presence, and he will honor you.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Jas-4-11" id="en-CEV-28228">Saying Cruel Things about Others</span></h3><p><span class="text Jas-4-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>My friends, don't say cruel things about others! If you do, or if you condemn others, you are condemning God's Law. And if you condemn the Law, you put yourself above the Law and refuse to obey either it </span> <span class="text Jas-4-12" id="en-CEV-28229"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>or God who gave it. God is our judge, and he can save or destroy us. What right do you have to condemn anyone?</span></p> <h3><span class="text Jas-4-13" id="en-CEV-28230">Warning against Bragging</span></h3><p><span class="text Jas-4-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup> You should know better than to say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to the city. We will do business there for a year and make a lot of money!” </span> <span class="text Jas-4-14" id="en-CEV-28231"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>What do you know about tomorrow? How can you be so sure about your life? It is nothing more than mist that appears for only a little while before it disappears. </span> <span class="text Jas-4-15" id="en-CEV-28232"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>You should say, “If the Lord lets us live, we will do these things.” </span> <span class="text Jas-4-16" id="en-CEV-28233"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Yet you are stupid enough to brag, and it is wrong to be so proud. </span> <span class="text Jas-4-17" id="en-CEV-28234"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>If you don't do what you know is right, you have sinned.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
