<h3><span class="text 1Tim-5-1" id="en-CEV-27651">How To Act toward Others</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text 1Tim-5-1"><span class="chapternum">5 </span>Don't correct an older man. Encourage him, as you would your own father. Treat younger men as you would your own brother, </span> <span class="text 1Tim-5-2" id="en-CEV-27652"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>and treat older women as you would your own mother. Show the same respect to younger women that you would to your sister.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Tim-5-3" id="en-CEV-27653"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Take care of any widow who is really in need. </span> <span class="text 1Tim-5-4" id="en-CEV-27654"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>But if a widow has children or grandchildren, they should learn to serve God by taking care of her, as she once took care of them. This is what God wants them to do. </span> <span class="text 1Tim-5-5" id="en-CEV-27655"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup> A widow who is really in need is one who doesn't have any relatives. She has faith in God, and she keeps praying to him night and day, asking for his help.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Tim-5-6" id="en-CEV-27656"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>A widow who thinks only about having a good time is already dead, even though she is still alive.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Tim-5-7" id="en-CEV-27657"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Tell all this to everyone, so they will do the right thing. </span> <span class="text 1Tim-5-8" id="en-CEV-27658"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>People who don't take care of their relatives, and especially their own families, have given up their faith. They are worse than someone who doesn't have faith in the Lord.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Tim-5-9" id="en-CEV-27659"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>For a widow to be put on the list of widows, she must be at least 60 years old, and she must have been faithful in marriage.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27659a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27659a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27659a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text 1Tim-5-10" id="en-CEV-27660"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>She must also be well-known for doing all sorts of good things, such as raising children, giving food to strangers, welcoming God's people into her home,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27660b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27660b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27660b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> helping people in need, and always making herself useful.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Tim-5-11" id="en-CEV-27661"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Don't put young widows on the list. They may later have a strong desire to get married. Then they will turn away from Christ </span> <span class="text 1Tim-5-12" id="en-CEV-27662"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>and become guilty of breaking their promise to him. </span> <span class="text 1Tim-5-13" id="en-CEV-27663"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Besides, they will become lazy and get into the habit of going from house to house. Next, they will start gossiping and become busybodies, talking about things that are none of their business.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Tim-5-14" id="en-CEV-27664"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>I would prefer that young widows get married, have children, and look after their families. Then the enemy won't have any reason to say insulting things about us. </span> <span class="text 1Tim-5-15" id="en-CEV-27665"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Look what's already happened to some of the young widows! They have turned away to follow Satan.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Tim-5-16" id="en-CEV-27666"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>If a woman who is a follower has any widows in her family, she<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27666c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27666c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27666c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> should help them. This will keep the church from having that burden, and then the church can help widows who are really in need.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 1Tim-5-17" id="en-CEV-27667">Church Leaders</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Tim-5-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Church leaders<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27667d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27667d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27667d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> who do their job well deserve to be paid<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27667e" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27667e" title="See footnote e"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27667e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> twice as much, especially if they work hard at preaching and teaching. </span> <span class="text 1Tim-5-18" id="en-CEV-27668"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup> It is just as the Scriptures say, “Don't muzzle an ox when you are using it to grind grain.” You also know the saying, “Workers are worth their pay.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Tim-5-19" id="en-CEV-27669"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup> Don't listen to any charge against a church leader, unless at least two or three people bring the same charges. </span> <span class="text 1Tim-5-20" id="en-CEV-27670"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>But if any of the leaders should keep on sinning, they must be corrected in front of the whole group, as a warning to everyone else.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Tim-5-21" id="en-CEV-27671"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>In the presence of God and Christ Jesus and their chosen angels, I order you to follow my instructions!

Take a little wine to help your stomach trouble and the other illnesses you often have.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Tim-5-24" id="en-CEV-27674"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>Some people get caught in their sins almost at once, even before the time of judgment. But other people's sins don't show up until later. </span> <span class="text 1Tim-5-25" id="en-CEV-27675"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>It is the same with good deeds. Some are easily seen, but none of them can be hidden.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
