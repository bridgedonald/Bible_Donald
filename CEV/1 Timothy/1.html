<p class="chapter-1"><span class="text 1Tim-1-1" id="en-CEV-27585"><span class="chapternum">1 </span>From Paul.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Tim-1-1">God our Savior and Christ Jesus commanded me to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, who gives us hope.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Tim-1-2" id="en-CEV-27586"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup> Timothy, because of our faith, you are like a son to me. I pray that God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ will be kind and merciful to you. May they bless you with peace!</span></p> <h3><span class="text 1Tim-1-3" id="en-CEV-27587">Warning against False Teaching</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Tim-1-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>When I was leaving for Macedonia, I asked you to stay on in Ephesus and warn certain people there to stop spreading their false teachings. </span> <span class="text 1Tim-1-4" id="en-CEV-27588"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>You needed to warn them to stop wasting their time on senseless stories and endless lists of ancestors. Such things only cause arguments. They don't help anyone to do God's work that can only be done by faith.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Tim-1-5" id="en-CEV-27589"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>You must teach people to have genuine love, as well as a good conscience and true faith. </span> <span class="text 1Tim-1-6" id="en-CEV-27590"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>There are some who have given up these for nothing but empty talk. </span> <span class="text 1Tim-1-7" id="en-CEV-27591"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>They want to be teachers of the Law of Moses. But they don't know what they are talking about, even though they think they do.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Tim-1-8" id="en-CEV-27592"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>We know the Law is good, if it is used in the right way. </span> <span class="text 1Tim-1-9" id="en-CEV-27593"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>We also understand it wasn't given to control people who please God, but to control lawbreakers, criminals, godless people, and sinners. It is for wicked and evil people, and for murderers, who would even kill their own parents. </span> <span class="text 1Tim-1-10" id="en-CEV-27594"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>The Law was written for people who are sexual perverts or who live as homosexuals or are kidnappers or liars or won't tell the truth in court. It is for anything else that opposes the correct teaching </span> <span class="text 1Tim-1-11" id="en-CEV-27595"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>of the good news the glorious and wonderful God has given me.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 1Tim-1-12" id="en-CEV-27596">Being Thankful for God's Kindness</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Tim-1-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me the strength for my work because he knew he could trust me. </span> <span class="text 1Tim-1-13" id="en-CEV-27597"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup> I used to say terrible and insulting things about him, and I was cruel. But Christ had mercy on me because I didn't know what I was doing, and I had not yet put my faith in him. </span> <span class="text 1Tim-1-14" id="en-CEV-27598"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Christ Jesus our Lord treated me with undeserved grace and has greatly blessed my life with faith and love just like his own.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Tim-1-15" id="en-CEV-27599"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>“Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.” This saying is true, and it can be trusted. I was the worst sinner of all! </span> <span class="text 1Tim-1-16" id="en-CEV-27600"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>But since I was worse than anyone else, God had mercy on me and let me be an example of the endless patience of Christ Jesus. He did this so that others would put their faith in Christ and have eternal life. </span> <span class="text 1Tim-1-17" id="en-CEV-27601"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>I pray that honor and glory will always be given to the only God, who lives forever and is the invisible and eternal King! Amen.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Tim-1-18" id="en-CEV-27602"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Timothy, my son, the instructions I am giving you are based on what some prophets<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27602a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27602a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27602a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> once said about you. If you follow these instructions, you will fight like a good soldier. </span> <span class="text 1Tim-1-19" id="en-CEV-27603"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>You will be faithful and have a clear conscience. Some people have made a mess of their faith because they didn't listen to their consciences. </span> <span class="text 1Tim-1-20" id="en-CEV-27604"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Two of them are Hymenaeus and Alexander. I have given these men over to the power of Satan, so they will learn not to oppose God.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
