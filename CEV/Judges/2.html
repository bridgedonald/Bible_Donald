And after Joshua sent the Israelites to take the land they had been promised, they remained faithful to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> until Joshua died at the age of 110. He was buried on his land in Timnath-Heres, in the hill country of Ephraim north of Mount Gaash. Even though Joshua was gone, the Israelites were faithful to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> during the lifetime of those men who had been leaders with Joshua and who had seen the wonderful things the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had done for Israel.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-2-10" id="en-CEV-5449"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>After a while the people of Joshua's generation died, and the next generation did not know the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> or any of the things he had done for Israel. </span> <span class="text Judg-2-11-Judg-2-13" id="en-CEV-5450"><sup class="versenum">11-13 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had brought their ancestors out of Egypt, and they had worshiped him. But now the Israelites stopped worshiping the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> and worshiped the idols of Baal and Astarte, as well as the idols of other gods from nearby nations.</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-2-11-Judg-2-13">The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> was so angry </span> <span class="text Judg-2-14-Judg-2-15" id="en-CEV-5451"><sup class="versenum">14-15 </sup>with the Israelites that he let other nations raid Israel and steal their crops and other possessions. Enemies were everywhere, and the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> always let them defeat Israel in battle. The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had warned Israel he would do this, and now the Israelites were miserable.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Judg-2-16" id="en-CEV-5452">The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> Chooses Leaders for Israel</span></h3><p><span class="text Judg-2-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>From time to time, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> would choose special leaders known as judges.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5452d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5452d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5452d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> These judges would lead the Israelites into battle and defeat the enemies that made raids on them. </span> <span class="text Judg-2-17" id="en-CEV-5453"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>In years gone by, the Israelites had been faithful to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, but now they were quick to be unfaithful and to refuse even to listen to these judges. The Israelites disobeyed the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, and instead of worshiping him, they worshiped other gods.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-2-18" id="en-CEV-5454"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>When enemies made life miserable for the Israelites, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> felt sorry for them. He would choose a judge and help that judge rescue Israel from its enemies. The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> was kind to Israel as long as that judge lived. </span> <span class="text Judg-2-19" id="en-CEV-5455"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>But afterwards, the Israelites would become even more sinful than their ancestors had been.

They won't obey me, </span> <span class="text Judg-2-21" id="en-CEV-5457"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>so I'll stop helping them defeat their enemies. Israel still had a lot of enemies when Joshua died, </span> <span class="text Judg-2-22" id="en-CEV-5458"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>and I'm going to let those enemies stay. I'll use them to test Israel, because then I can find out if Israel will worship and obey me as their ancestors did.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-2-23" id="en-CEV-5459"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>That's why the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had not let Joshua get rid of those enemy nations all at once.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
