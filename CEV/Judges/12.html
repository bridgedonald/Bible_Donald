<h3><span class="text Judg-12-1" id="en-CEV-5738">The Ephraim Tribe Fights Jephthah's Army</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Judg-12-1"><span class="chapternum">12 </span>The men of the Ephraim tribe got together an army and went across the Jordan River to Zaphon to meet with Jephthah. They said, “Why did you go to war with the Ammonites without asking us to help? Just for that, we're going to burn down your house with you inside!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-12-2" id="en-CEV-5739"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>“But I did ask for your help,” Jephthah answered. “That was back when the people of Gilead and I were having trouble with the Ammonites, and you wouldn't do a thing to help us. </span> <span class="text Judg-12-3" id="en-CEV-5740"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>So when we realized you weren't coming, we risked our lives and attacked the Ammonites. And the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> let us defeat them. There's no reason for you to come here today to attack me.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-12-4" id="en-CEV-5741"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>But the men from Ephraim said, “You people of Gilead are nothing more than refugees from Ephraim. You even live on land that belongs to the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh.”<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5741a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5741a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5741a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></span></p><p><span class="text Judg-12-4">So Jephthah called together the army of Gilead, then they attacked and defeated the army from Ephraim. </span> <span class="text Judg-12-5" id="en-CEV-5742"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>The army of Gilead also posted guards at all the places where the soldiers from Ephraim could cross the Jordan River to return to their own land.</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-12-5">Whenever one of the men from Ephraim would try to cross the river, the guards would say, “Are you from Ephraim?”</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-12-5">“No,” the man would answer, “I'm not from Ephraim.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-12-6" id="en-CEV-5743"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>The guards would then tell them to say “Shibboleth,” because they knew that people of Ephraim could say “Sibboleth,” but not “Shibboleth.”</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-12-6">If the man said “Sibboleth,” the guards would grab him and kill him right there. Altogether, 42,000 men from Ephraim were killed in the battle and at the Jordan.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-12-7" id="en-CEV-5744"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Jephthah was a leader<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5744b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5744b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5744b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> of Israel for six years, before he died and was buried in his hometown Mizpah<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5744c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5744c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5744c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> in Gilead.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Judg-12-8" id="en-CEV-5745">Ibzan</span></h3><p><span class="text Judg-12-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Ibzan, the next leader<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5745d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5745d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5745d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> of Israel, came from Bethlehem. </span> <span class="text Judg-12-9" id="en-CEV-5746"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>He had 30 daughters and 30 sons, and he let them all marry outside his clan.</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-12-9">Ibzan was a leader for seven years, </span> <span class="text Judg-12-10" id="en-CEV-5747"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>before he died and was buried in Bethlehem.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Judg-12-11" id="en-CEV-5748">Elon</span></h3><p><span class="text Judg-12-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Elon from the Zebulun tribe was the next leader<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5748e" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5748e" title="See footnote e"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5748e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> of Israel.
