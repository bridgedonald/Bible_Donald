The other tribes had land, but the people of Dan did not really have any to call their own. </span> <span class="text Judg-18-2" id="en-CEV-5853"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>The tribe chose five warriors to represent their clans and told them, “Go and find some land where we can live.”</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-18-2">The warriors left the area of Zorah and Eshtaol and went into the hill country of Ephraim. One night they stayed at Micah's house, </span> <span class="text Judg-18-3" id="en-CEV-5854"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>because they heard the young Levite talking, and they knew from his accent that he was from the south. They asked him, “What are you doing here? Who brought you here?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-18-4" id="en-CEV-5855"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>The Levite replied, “Micah hired me as his priest.” Then he told them how well Micah had treated him.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-18-5" id="en-CEV-5856"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>“Please talk to God for us,” the men said. “Ask God if we will be successful in what we are trying to do.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-18-6" id="en-CEV-5857"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>“Don't worry,” answered the priest. “The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> is pleased with what you are doing.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-18-7" id="en-CEV-5858"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>The five men left and went to the town of Laish, whose people were from Sidon,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5858a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5858a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5858a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> but Sidon was too far away to protect them. Even though their town had no walls, the people thought they were safe from attack. So they had not asked anyone else<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5858b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5858b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5858b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> for protection, which meant that the tribe of Dan could easily take over Laish.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5858c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5858c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5858c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-18-8" id="en-CEV-5859"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>The five men went back to Zorah and Eshtaol, where their relatives asked, “Did you find any land?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-18-9-Judg-18-10" id="en-CEV-5860"><sup class="versenum">9-10 </sup>“Let's go!” the five men said. “We saw some very good land with enough room for all of us, and it has everything we will ever need. What are you waiting for? Let's attack and take it. You'll find that the people think they're safe, but God is giving the land to us.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-18-11" id="en-CEV-5861"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Six hundred men from the tribe of Dan strapped on their weapons and left Zorah and Eshtaol with their families.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5861d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5861d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5861d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Judg-18-12" id="en-CEV-5862"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>One night they camped near Kiriath-Jearim in the territory of Judah, and that's why the place just west of Kiriath-Jearim is still known as Dan's Camp.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5862e" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5862e" title="See footnote e"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5862e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Judg-18-13" id="en-CEV-5863"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Then they went into the hill country of Ephraim.</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-18-13">When they came close to Micah's house, </span> <span class="text Judg-18-14" id="en-CEV-5864"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>the five men who had been spies asked the other warriors, “Did you know that someone in this village has several idols and a sacred priestly vest? What do you think we should do about it?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-18-15-Judg-18-18" id="en-CEV-5865"><sup class="versenum">15-18 </sup>The 600 warriors left the road and went to the house on Micah's property where the young Levite priest lived. They stood at the gate and greeted the priest. Meanwhile, the five men who had been there before went into Micah's house and took the sacred priestly vest and the idols.</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-18-15-Judg-18-18">“Hey!” the priest shouted. “What do you think you're doing?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-18-19" id="en-CEV-5866"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>“Quiet!” the men said. “Keep your mouth shut and listen. Why don't you come with us and be our priest, so you can tell us what God wants us to do? You could stay here and be a priest for one man's family, but wouldn't you rather be the priest for a clan or even a whole tribe of Israel?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-18-20" id="en-CEV-5867"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>The priest really liked that idea. So he took the vest and the idols and joined the others </span> <span class="text Judg-18-21" id="en-CEV-5868"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>from the tribe of Dan. Then they turned and left, after putting their children, their cattle, and the rest of their other possessions in front.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-18-22" id="en-CEV-5869"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>They had traveled for some time before Micah asked his neighbors to help him get his things back. He and his men caught up with the people of Dan </span> <span class="text Judg-18-23" id="en-CEV-5870"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>and shouted for them to stop.</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-18-23">They turned to face him and asked, “What's wrong? Why did you bring all these men?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-18-24" id="en-CEV-5871"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>Micah answered, “You know what's wrong. You stole the gods<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5871f" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5871f" title="See footnote f"&gt;f&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5871f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> I made, and you took my priest. I don't have anything left.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-18-25" id="en-CEV-5872"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>“We don't want to hear any more about it,” the people of Dan said. “And if you make us angry, you'll only get yourself and your family killed.” </span> <span class="text Judg-18-26" id="en-CEV-5873"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>After saying this, they turned and left.</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-18-26">Micah realized there was no way he could win a fight with them, and so he went back home.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Judg-18-27-Judg-18-28" id="en-CEV-5874">The Tribe of Dan Captures Laish</span></h3><p><span class="text Judg-18-27-Judg-18-28"><sup class="versenum">27-28 </sup>The tribe of Dan took Micah's priest and the things Micah had made, and headed for Laish, which was located in a valley controlled by the town of Beth-Rehob. Laish was defenseless, because it had no walls and was too far from Sidon for the Sidonians to help defend it. The leaders of Laish had not even asked nearby towns to help them in case of an attack.</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-18-27-Judg-18-28">The warriors from Dan made a surprise attack on Laish, killing everyone and burning it down. Then they rebuilt the town and settled there themselves. </span> <span class="text Judg-18-29" id="en-CEV-5875"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>But they named it Dan, after one of Israel's<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5875g" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5875g" title="See footnote g"&gt;g&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5875g" title="See footnote g">g</a>]</sup> sons, who was the ancestor of their tribe.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-18-30-Judg-18-31" id="en-CEV-5876"><sup class="versenum">30-31 </sup>Even though the place of worship<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5876h" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5876h" title="See footnote h"&gt;h&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5876h" title="See footnote h">h</a>]</sup> was in Shiloh, the people of Dan set up the idol Micah had made.
