<h3><span class="text Judg-11-1-Judg-11-5" id="en-CEV-5702">Jephthah</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Judg-11-1-Judg-11-5"><span class="chapternum">11 </span><sup class="versenum">1-5 </sup>The leaders of the Gilead clan decided to ask a brave warrior named Jephthah son of Gilead to lead the attack against the Ammonites.</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-11-1-Judg-11-5">Even though Jephthah belonged to the Gilead clan, he had earlier been forced to leave the region where they had lived. Jephthah was the son of a prostitute, but his half brothers were the sons of his father's wife.</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-11-1-Judg-11-5">One day his half brothers told him, “You don't really belong to our family, so you can't have any of the family property.” Then they forced Jephthah to leave home.</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-11-1-Judg-11-5">Jephthah went to the country of Tob, where he was joined by a number of men who would do anything for money.</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-11-1-Judg-11-5">So the leaders of Gilead went to Jephthah and said, </span> <span class="text Judg-11-6" id="en-CEV-5703"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>“Please come back to Gilead! If you lead our army, we will be able to fight off the Ammonites.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-11-7" id="en-CEV-5704"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>“Didn't you hate me?” Jephthah replied. “Weren't you the ones who forced me to leave my family? You're only coming to me now because you're in trouble.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-11-8" id="en-CEV-5705"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>“But we do want you to come back,” the leaders said. “And if you lead us in battle against the Ammonites, we will make you the ruler of Gilead.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-11-9" id="en-CEV-5706"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>“All right,” Jephthah said. “If I go back with you and the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> lets me defeat the Ammonites, will you really make me your ruler?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-11-10" id="en-CEV-5707"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>“You have our word,” the leaders answered. “And the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> is a witness to what we have said.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-11-11" id="en-CEV-5708"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>So Jephthah went back to Mizpah<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5708a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5708a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5708a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> with the leaders of Gilead. The people of Gilead gathered at the place of worship and made Jephthah their ruler. Jephthah also made promises to them.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-11-12" id="en-CEV-5709"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>After the ceremony, Jephthah sent messengers to say to the king of Ammon, “Are you trying to start a war? You have invaded my country, and I want to know why!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-11-13" id="en-CEV-5710"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>The king of Ammon replied, “Tell Jephthah that the land really belongs to me, all the way from the Arnon River in the south, to the Jabbok River in the north, and west to the Jordan River. When the Israelites came out of Egypt, they stole it. Tell Jephthah to return it to me, and there won't be any war.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-11-14" id="en-CEV-5711"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Jephthah sent the messengers back to the king of Ammon, </span> <span class="text Judg-11-15" id="en-CEV-5712"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>and they told him that Jephthah had said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Judg-11-15">Israel hasn't taken any territory from Moab or Ammon. </span> <span class="text Judg-11-16" id="en-CEV-5713"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>When the Israelites came from Egypt, they traveled across the desert to the Red Sea<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5713b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5713b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5713b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> and then to Kadesh. </span> <span class="text Judg-11-17" id="en-CEV-5714"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup> They sent messengers to the king of Edom and said, “Please, let us go through your country.” But the king of Edom refused. They also sent messengers to the king of Moab, but he wouldn't let them cross his country either. And so the Israelites stayed at Kadesh.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Judg-11-18" id="en-CEV-5715"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup> A little later, the Israelites set out into the desert, going east of Edom and Moab, and camping on the eastern side of the Arnon River gorge. The Arnon is the eastern border of Moab, and since the Israelites didn't cross it, they didn't even set foot in Moab.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Judg-11-19" id="en-CEV-5716"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup> The Israelites sent messengers to the Amorite King Sihon of Heshbon. “Please,” they said, “let our people go through your country to get to our own land.”</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Judg-11-20" id="en-CEV-5717"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Sihon didn't think the Israelites could be trusted, so he called his army together. They set up camp at Jahaz, then they attacked the Israelite camp. </span> <span class="text Judg-11-21" id="en-CEV-5718"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>But the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God helped Israel defeat Sihon and his army. Israel took over all of the Amorite land where Sihon's people had lived, </span> <span class="text Judg-11-22" id="en-CEV-5719"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>from the Arnon River in the south to the Jabbok River in the north, and from the desert in the east to the Jordan River in the west.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-11-23" id="en-CEV-5720"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>The messengers also told the king of Ammon that Jephthah had said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Judg-11-23">The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God of Israel helped his nation get rid of the Amorites and take their land. Now do you think you're going to take over that same territory? </span> <span class="text Judg-11-24" id="en-CEV-5721"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>If Chemosh your god<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5721c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5721c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5721c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> takes over a country and gives it to you, don't you have a right to it? And if the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> takes over a country and gives it to us, the land is ours!</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Judg-11-25" id="en-CEV-5722"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup> Are you better than Balak the son of Zippor? He was the king of Moab, but he didn't quarrel with Israel or start a war with us.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Judg-11-26" id="en-CEV-5723"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>For 300 years, Israelites have been living in Heshbon and Aroer and the nearby villages, and in the towns along the Arnon River gorge. If the land really belonged to you Ammonites, you wouldn't have waited until now to try to get it back.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Judg-11-27" id="en-CEV-5724"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>I haven't done anything to you, but it's certainly wrong of you to start a war. I pray that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will show whether Israel or Ammon is in the right.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-11-28" id="en-CEV-5725"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>But the king of Ammon paid no attention to Jephthah's message.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-11-29" id="en-CEV-5726"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>Then the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s Spirit took control of Jephthah, and Jephthah went through Gilead and Manasseh, raising an army. Finally, he arrived at Mizpah in Gilead, where </span> <span class="text Judg-11-30" id="en-CEV-5727"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>he promised the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, “If you will let me defeat the Ammonites </span> <span class="text Judg-11-31" id="en-CEV-5728"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>and come home safely, I will sacrifice to you whoever comes out to meet me first.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-11-32" id="en-CEV-5729"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>From Mizpah, Jephthah attacked the Ammonites, and the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> helped him defeat them.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-11-33" id="en-CEV-5730"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>Jephthah and his army destroyed the 20 towns between Aroer and Minnith, and others as far as Abel-Keramim. After that, the Ammonites could not invade Israel any more.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Judg-11-34" id="en-CEV-5731">Jephthah's Daughter</span></h3><p><span class="text Judg-11-34"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>When Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah, the first one to meet him was his daughter. She was playing a tambourine and dancing to celebrate his victory, and she was his only child.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-11-35" id="en-CEV-5732"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup> “Oh no!” Jephthah cried. Then he tore his clothes in sorrow and said to his daughter, “I made a sacred promise to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, and I must keep it. Your coming out to meet me has broken my heart.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-11-36" id="en-CEV-5733"><sup class="versenum">36 </sup>“Father,” she said, “you made a sacred promise to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, and he let you defeat the Ammonites. Now, you must do what you promised, even if it means I must die. </span> <span class="text Judg-11-37" id="en-CEV-5734"><sup class="versenum">37 </sup>But first, please let me spend two months, wandering in the hill country with my friends. We will cry together, because I can never get married and have children.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-11-38" id="en-CEV-5735"><sup class="versenum">38 </sup>“Yes, you may have two months,” Jephthah said.</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-11-38">She and some other girls left, and for two months they wandered in the hill country, crying because she could never get married and have children. </span> <span class="text Judg-11-39" id="en-CEV-5736"><sup class="versenum">39 </sup>Then she went back to her father. He did what he had promised, and she never got married.</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-11-39">That's why </span> <span class="text Judg-11-40" id="en-CEV-5737"><sup class="versenum">40 </sup>every year, Israelite girls walk around for four days, weeping for<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5737d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5737d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5737d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> Jephthah's daughter.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
