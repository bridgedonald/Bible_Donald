And since they were God's people, the meeting was held at the place of worship in Mizpah. Men who could serve as soldiers came from everywhere in Israel—from Dan in the north, Beersheba in the south, and Gilead east of the Jordan River. Four hundred thousand of them came to Mizpah, and they each felt the same about what those men from the tribe of Benjamin had done.</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-20-1-Judg-20-3">News about the meeting at Mizpah reached the tribe of Benjamin.</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-20-1-Judg-20-3">As soon as the leaders of the tribes of Israel took their places, the Israelites said, “How could such a horrible thing happen?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-20-4" id="en-CEV-5908"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>The husband of the murdered woman answered:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Judg-20-4">My wife<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5908a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5908a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5908a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> and I went into the town of Gibeah in Benjamin to spend the night. </span> <span class="text Judg-20-5" id="en-CEV-5909"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Later that night, the men of Gibeah surrounded the house.
