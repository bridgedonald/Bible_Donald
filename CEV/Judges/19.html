<h3><span class="text Judg-19-1" id="en-CEV-5877">A Woman Is Murdered</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Judg-19-1"><span class="chapternum">19 </span>Before kings ruled Israel, a Levite<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5877a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5877a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5877a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> was living deep in the hill country of the Ephraim tribe. He married<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5877b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5877b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5877b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> a woman from Bethlehem in Judah, </span> <span class="text Judg-19-2" id="en-CEV-5878"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>but she was unfaithful and went back to live with her family in Bethlehem.</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-19-2">Four months later </span> <span class="text Judg-19-3" id="en-CEV-5879"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>her husband decided to try and talk her into coming back. So he went to Bethlehem, taking along a servant and two donkeys. He talked with his wife, and she invited him into her family's home. Her father was glad to see him </span> <span class="text Judg-19-4" id="en-CEV-5880"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>and did not want him to leave. So the man stayed three days, eating and drinking with his father-in-law.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-19-5" id="en-CEV-5881"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>When everyone got up on the fourth day, the Levite started getting ready to go home. But his father-in-law said, “Don't leave until you have a bite to eat. You'll need strength for your journey.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-19-6" id="en-CEV-5882"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>The two men sat down together and ate a big meal. “Come on,” the man's father-in-law said. “Stay tonight and have a good time.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-19-7" id="en-CEV-5883"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>The Levite tried to leave, but his father-in-law insisted, and he spent one more night there. </span> <span class="text Judg-19-8" id="en-CEV-5884"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>The fifth day, the man got up early to leave, but his wife's father said, “You need to keep up your strength! Why don't you leave right after lunch?” So the two of them started eating.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-19-9" id="en-CEV-5885"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Finally, the Levite got up from the meal, so he and his wife and servant could leave. “Look,” his father-in-law said, “it's already late afternoon, and if you leave now, you won't get very far before dark. Stay with us one more night and enjoy yourself. Then you can get up early tomorrow morning and start home.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-19-10" id="en-CEV-5886"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>But the Levite decided not to spend the night there again. He had the saddles put on his two donkeys, then he and his wife and servant traveled as far as Jebus, which is now called Jerusalem. </span> <span class="text Judg-19-11" id="en-CEV-5887"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>It was beginning to get dark, and the man's servant said, “Let's stop and spend the night in this town where the Jebusites live.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-19-12" id="en-CEV-5888"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>“No,” the Levite answered. “They aren't Israelites, and I refuse to spend the night there. We'll stop for the night at Gibeah, </span> <span class="text Judg-19-13" id="en-CEV-5889"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>or maybe we can even reach Ramah<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5889c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5889c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5889c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> before dark.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-19-14" id="en-CEV-5890"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>They walked on and reached Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin just after sunset. </span> <span class="text Judg-19-15" id="en-CEV-5891"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>They left the road and went into Gibeah. But the Levite couldn't find a house where anyone would let them spend the night, and they sat down in the open area just inside the town gates.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-19-16" id="en-CEV-5892"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Soon an old man came in through the gates on his way home from working in the fields. Most of the people who lived in Gibeah belonged to the tribe of Benjamin, but this man was originally from the hill country of Ephraim. </span> <span class="text Judg-19-17" id="en-CEV-5893"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>He noticed that the Levite was just in town to spend the night. “Where are you going?” the old man asked. “Where did you come from?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-19-18" id="en-CEV-5894"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>“We've come from Bethlehem in Judah,” the Levite answered. “We went there on a visit. Now we're going to the place where the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> is worshiped, and later we will return to our home in the hill country of Ephraim. But no one here will let us spend the night<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5894d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5894d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5894d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> in their home. </span> <span class="text Judg-19-19" id="en-CEV-5895"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>We brought food for our donkeys and bread and wine for ourselves, so we don't need anything except a place to sleep.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-19-20" id="en-CEV-5896"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>The old man said, “You are welcome to spend the night in my home and to be my guest, but don't stay out here!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-19-21" id="en-CEV-5897"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>The old man brought them into his house and fed their donkeys. Then he and his guests washed their feet<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5897e" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5897e" title="See footnote e"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5897e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> and began eating and drinking. </span> <span class="text Judg-19-22" id="en-CEV-5898"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup> They were having a good time, when some worthless men of that town surrounded the house and started banging on the door and shouting, “A man came to your house tonight. Send him out, so we can have sex with him!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-19-23" id="en-CEV-5899"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>The old man went outside and said, “My friends, please don't commit such a horrible crime against a man who is a guest in my house. </span> <span class="text Judg-19-24" id="en-CEV-5900"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>Let me send out my daughter instead. She's a virgin. And I'll even send out the man's wife.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5900f" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5900f" title="See footnote f"&gt;f&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5900f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> You can rape them or do whatever else you want, but please don't do such a horrible thing to this man.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-19-25" id="en-CEV-5901"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>The men refused to listen, so the Levite grabbed his wife and shoved her outside. The men raped her and abused her all night long. Finally, they let her go just before sunrise, </span> <span class="text Judg-19-26" id="en-CEV-5902"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>and it was almost daybreak when she went back to the house where her husband<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5902g" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5902g" title="See footnote g"&gt;g&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5902g" title="See footnote g">g</a>]</sup> was staying. She collapsed at the door and lay there until sunrise.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-19-27" id="en-CEV-5903"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>About that time, her husband woke up and got ready to leave. He opened the door and went outside, where he found his wife lying at the door with her hands on the doorstep. </span> <span class="text Judg-19-28" id="en-CEV-5904"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>“Get up!” he said. “It's time to leave.”</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-19-28">But his wife didn't move.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5904h" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5904h" title="See footnote h"&gt;h&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5904h" title="See footnote h">h</a>]</sup></span></p><p><span class="text Judg-19-28">He lifted her body onto his donkey and left. </span> <span class="text Judg-19-29" id="en-CEV-5905"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup> When he got home, he took a butcher knife and cut her body into twelve pieces. Then he told some messengers, “Take one piece to each tribe of Israel </span> <span class="text Judg-19-30" id="en-CEV-5906"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>and ask everyone if anything like this has ever happened since Israel left Egypt.
