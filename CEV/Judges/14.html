Get her for me!”<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5775a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5775a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5775a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-14-3" id="en-CEV-5776"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>His parents answered, “There are a lot of women in our clan and even more in the rest of Israel. Those Philistines are pagans. Why would you want to marry one of their women?”</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-14-3">“She looks good to me,” Samson answered. “Get her for me!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-14-4" id="en-CEV-5777"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>At that time, the Philistines were in control of Israel, and the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> wanted to stir up trouble for them. That's why he made Samson desire that woman.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-14-5" id="en-CEV-5778"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>As Samson and his parents reached the vineyards near Timnah, a fierce young lion suddenly roared and attacked Samson. </span> <span class="text Judg-14-6" id="en-CEV-5779"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>But the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s Spirit took control of Samson, and with his bare hands he tore the lion apart, as though it had been a young goat. His parents didn't know what he had done, and he didn't tell them.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-14-7" id="en-CEV-5780"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>When they got to Timnah, Samson talked to the woman, and he was sure that she was the one for him.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-14-8" id="en-CEV-5781"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Later,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5781b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5781b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5781b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> Samson returned to Timnah for the wedding. And when he came near the place where the lion had attacked, he left the road to see what was left of the lion. He was surprised to see that bees were living in the lion's skeleton, and that they had made some honey. </span> <span class="text Judg-14-9" id="en-CEV-5782"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>He scooped up the honey in his hands and ate some of it as he walked along. When he got back to his parents, he gave them some of the honey, and they ate it too. But he didn't tell them he had found the honey in the skeleton of a lion.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5782c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5782c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5782c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-14-10" id="en-CEV-5783"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>While Samson's father went to make the final arrangements with the bride and her family, Samson threw a big party,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5783d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5783d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5783d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> as grooms<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5783e" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5783e" title="See footnote e"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5783e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> usually did. </span> <span class="text Judg-14-11" id="en-CEV-5784"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>When the Philistines saw what Samson was like, they told 30 of their young men to stay with him at the party.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-14-12" id="en-CEV-5785"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Samson told the 30 young men, “This party will last for seven days. Let's make a bet: I'll tell you a riddle, and if you can tell me the answer before the party is over, I'll give each of you a shirt and a full change of clothing. </span> <span class="text Judg-14-13" id="en-CEV-5786"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>But if you can't tell me the answer, then each of you will have to give me a shirt and a full change of clothing.”</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-14-13">“It's a bet!” the Philistines said. “Tell us the riddle.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-14-14" id="en-CEV-5787"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Samson said:</span></p><div class="poetry"><p class="line"><span class="text Judg-14-14">Once so strong and mighty—</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Judg-14-14">now so sweet and tasty!</span></span></p></div><p class="top-1"><span class="text Judg-14-14">Three days went by, and the Philistine young men had not come up with the right answer. </span> <span class="text Judg-14-15" id="en-CEV-5788"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Finally, on the seventh<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5788f" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5788f" title="See footnote f"&gt;f&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5788f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> day of the party they went to Samson's bride and said, “You had better trick your husband into telling you the answer to his riddle. Have you invited us here just to rob us? If you don't find out the answer, we will burn you and your family to death.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-14-16" id="en-CEV-5789"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Samson's bride went to him and started crying in his arms. “You must really hate me,” she sobbed. “If you loved me at all, you would have told me the answer to your riddle.”</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-14-16">“But I haven't even told my parents the answer!” Samson replied. “Why should I tell you?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-14-17" id="en-CEV-5790"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>For the entire seven days of the party, she had been whining and trying to get the answer from him. But that seventh day she put so much pressure on Samson that he finally gave in and told her the answer.
