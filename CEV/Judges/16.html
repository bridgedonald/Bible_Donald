So they went to the city gate and waited all night in the guardrooms on each side of the gate.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5814a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5814a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5814a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-16-3" id="en-CEV-5815"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>But Samson got up in the middle of the night and went to the town gate. He pulled the gate doors and doorposts out of the wall and put them on his shoulders. Then he carried them all the way to the top of the hill that overlooks Hebron,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5815b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5815b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5815b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> where he set the doors down, still closed and locked.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Judg-16-4" id="en-CEV-5816">Delilah Tricks Samson</span></h3><p><span class="text Judg-16-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Some time later, Samson fell in love with a woman named Delilah, who lived in Sorek Valley. </span> <span class="text Judg-16-5" id="en-CEV-5817"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>The Philistine rulers<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5817c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5817c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5817c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> went to Delilah and said, “Trick Samson into telling you what makes him so strong and what can make him weak. Then we can tie him up so he can't get away. If you find out his secret, we will each give you 1,100 pieces of silver.”<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5817d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5817d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5817d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-16-6" id="en-CEV-5818"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>The next time Samson was at Delilah's house, she asked, “Samson, what makes you so strong?

Come on, you can tell me.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-16-7" id="en-CEV-5819"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Samson answered, “If someone ties me up with seven new bowstrings that have never been dried,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5819e" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5819e" title="See footnote e"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5819e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> it will make me just as weak as anyone else.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-16-8-Judg-16-9" id="en-CEV-5820"><sup class="versenum">8-9 </sup>The Philistine rulers gave seven new bowstrings to Delilah. They also told some of their soldiers to go to Delilah's house and hide in the room where Samson and Delilah were. If the bowstrings made Samson weak, they would be able to capture him.</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-16-8-Judg-16-9">Delilah tied up Samson with the bowstrings and shouted, “Samson, the Philistines are attacking!”</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-16-8-Judg-16-9">Samson snapped the bowstrings, as though they were pieces of scorched string. The Philistines had not found out why Samson was so strong.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-16-10" id="en-CEV-5821"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>“You lied and made me look like a fool,” Delilah said. “Now tell me. How can I really tie you up?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-16-11" id="en-CEV-5822"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Samson answered, “Use some new ropes.

Then he pulled his hair free from the woven cloth.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-16-15" id="en-CEV-5826"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>“Samson,” Delilah said, “you claim to love me, but you don't mean it!

So she sent someone to tell the Philistine rulers, “Come to my house one more time. Samson has finally told me the truth.”</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-16-18">The Philistine rulers went to Delilah's house, and they brought along the silver they had promised her. </span> <span class="text Judg-16-19" id="en-CEV-5830"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Delilah had lulled Samson to sleep with his head resting in her lap. She signaled to one of the Philistine men as she began cutting off Samson's seven braids. And by the time she was finished, Samson's strength was gone. Delilah tied him up </span> <span class="text Judg-16-20" id="en-CEV-5831"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>and shouted, “Samson, the Philistines are attacking!”</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-16-20">Samson woke up and thought, “I'll break loose and escape, just as I always do.” He did not realize that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had stopped helping him.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-16-21" id="en-CEV-5832"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>The Philistines grabbed Samson and poked out his eyes. They took him to the prison in Gaza and chained him up. Then they put him to work, turning a millstone to grind grain. </span> <span class="text Judg-16-22" id="en-CEV-5833"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>But they didn't cut his hair any more, so it started growing back.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-16-23" id="en-CEV-5834"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>The Philistine rulers threw a big party and sacrificed a lot of animals to their god Dagon.
