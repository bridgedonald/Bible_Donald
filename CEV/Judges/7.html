The rest of you may go home, but leave your food and trumpets with us.”</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-7-8">Gideon's army camp was on top of a hill overlooking the Midianite camp in the valley.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-7-9" id="en-CEV-5583"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>That night, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to Gideon. “Get up!

Then he went back to the Israelite camp and shouted, “Let's go! The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> is going to let us defeat the Midianite army.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-7-16" id="en-CEV-5590"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Gideon divided his little army into three groups of 100 men, and he gave each soldier a trumpet and a large clay jar with a burning torch inside. </span> <span class="text Judg-7-17-Judg-7-18" id="en-CEV-5591"><sup class="versenum">17-18 </sup>Gideon said, “When we get to the enemy camp, spread out and surround it.

Fight for Gideon!’ ”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-7-19" id="en-CEV-5592"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Gideon and his group reached the edge of the enemy camp a few hours after dark, just after the new guards had come on duty.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5592g" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5592g" title="See footnote g"&gt;g&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5592g" title="See footnote g">g</a>]</sup> Gideon and his soldiers blew their trumpets and smashed the clay jars that were hiding the torches. </span> <span class="text Judg-7-20" id="en-CEV-5593"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>The rest of Gideon's soldiers blew the trumpets they were holding in their right hands. Then they smashed the jars and held the burning torches in their left hands.

Gideon's troops stayed in their positions surrounding the camp </span> <span class="text Judg-7-22" id="en-CEV-5595"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>and blew their trumpets again. As they did, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> made the enemy soldiers pull out their swords and start fighting each other.</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-7-22">The enemy army tried to escape from the camp.
