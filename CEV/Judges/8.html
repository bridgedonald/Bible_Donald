Why did you treat us like that?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-8-2" id="en-CEV-5600"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Gideon answered:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Judg-8-2">Don't be upset! Even though you came later, you were able to do much more than I did. It's just like the grape harvest: The grapes your tribe doesn't even bother to pick are better than the best grapes my family can grow. </span> <span class="text Judg-8-3" id="en-CEV-5601"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup> Besides, God chose you to capture Raven and Wolf. I didn't do a thing compared to you.</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-8-3">By the time Gideon had finished talking, the men of Ephraim had calmed down and were no longer angry with him.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Judg-8-4" id="en-CEV-5602">Gideon Finishes Destroying the Midianite Army</span></h3><p><span class="text Judg-8-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>After Gideon and his 300 troops had chased the Midianites across the Jordan River, they were exhausted. </span> <span class="text Judg-8-5" id="en-CEV-5603"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>The town of Succoth was nearby, so he went there and asked, “Please give my troops some food. They are worn out, but we have to keep chasing Zebah and Zalmunna, the two Midianite kings.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-8-6" id="en-CEV-5604"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>The town leaders of Succoth answered, “Why should we feed your army? We don't know if you really will defeat Zebah and Zalmunna.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-8-7" id="en-CEV-5605"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>“Just wait!” Gideon said. “After the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> helps me defeat them, I'm coming back here. I'll make a whip out of thorns and rip the flesh from your bones.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-8-8" id="en-CEV-5606"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>After leaving Succoth, Gideon went to Penuel and asked the leaders there for some food. But he got the same answer as he did at Succoth. </span> <span class="text Judg-8-9" id="en-CEV-5607"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>“I'll come back safe and sound,” Gideon said, “but when I do, I'm going to tear down your tower!”<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5607a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5607a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5607a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-8-10" id="en-CEV-5608"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5608b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5608b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5608b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> with an army of 15,000 troops. They were all that was left of the army of the eastern nations, because 120,000 of their warriors had been killed in the battle.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-8-11" id="en-CEV-5609"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Gideon reached the enemy camp by going east along Nomad<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5609c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5609c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5609c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> Road past Nobah and Jogbehah. He made a surprise attack, </span> <span class="text Judg-8-12" id="en-CEV-5610"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>and the enemy panicked.

As he was going through Heres Pass, </span> <span class="text Judg-8-14" id="en-CEV-5612"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>he caught a young man who lived in Succoth. Gideon asked him who the town officials of Succoth were, and the young man wrote down 77 names.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-8-15" id="en-CEV-5613"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Gideon went to the town officials and said, “Here are Zebah and Zalmunna. Remember how you made fun of me? You said, ‘We don't know if you really will defeat those two Midianite kings. So why should we feed your worn-out army?’ ”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-8-16" id="en-CEV-5614"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Gideon made a whip from thorn plants and used it to beat the town officials. </span> <span class="text Judg-8-17" id="en-CEV-5615"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Afterwards he went to Penuel, where he tore down the tower and killed all the town officials.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5615d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5615d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5615d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-8-18" id="en-CEV-5616"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Then Gideon said, “Zebah and Zalmunna, tell me about the men you killed at Tabor.”</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-8-18">“They were a lot like you,” the two kings answered. “They were dignified, almost like royalty.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-8-19" id="en-CEV-5617"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>“They were my very own brothers!” Gideon said. “I swear by the living <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> that if you had let them live, I would let you live.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-8-20" id="en-CEV-5618"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Gideon turned to Jether, his oldest son. “Kill them!” Gideon said.</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-8-20">But Jether was young,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5618e" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5618e" title="See footnote e"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5618e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> and he was too afraid to even pull out his sword.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-8-21" id="en-CEV-5619"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>“What's the matter, Gideon?” Zebah and Zalmunna asked. “Do it yourself, if you're not too much of a coward!”</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-8-21">Gideon jumped up and killed them both. Then he took the gold ornaments from the necks of their camels.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Judg-8-22" id="en-CEV-5620">The Israelites Ask Gideon To Be Their King</span></h3><p><span class="text Judg-8-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>After the battle with the Midianites, the Israelites said, “Gideon, you rescued us! Now we want you to be our king. Then after your death, your son and then your grandson will rule.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-8-23" id="en-CEV-5621"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>“No,” Gideon replied, “I won't be your king, and my son won't be king either.

In addition, there was the gold from the camels' ornaments and from the beautiful jewelry worn by the Midianite kings.
