<h3><span class="text Judg-4-1" id="en-CEV-5484">Deborah and Barak</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Judg-4-1"><span class="chapternum">4 </span>After the death of Ehud, the Israelites again started disobeying the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>. </span> <span class="text Judg-4-2" id="en-CEV-5485"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>So the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> let the Canaanite King Jabin of Hazor conquer Israel. Sisera, the commander of Jabin's army, lived in Harosheth-Ha-Goiim. </span> <span class="text Judg-4-3" id="en-CEV-5486"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Jabin's army had 900 iron chariots, and for 20 years he made life miserable for the Israelites, until finally they begged the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> for help.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-4-4" id="en-CEV-5487"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Deborah the wife of Lappidoth was a prophet and a leader<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5487a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5487a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5487a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> of Israel during those days. </span> <span class="text Judg-4-5" id="en-CEV-5488"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>She would sit under Deborah's Palm Tree between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, where Israelites would come and ask her to settle their legal cases.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-4-6" id="en-CEV-5489"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>One day, Barak the son of Abinoam was in Kedesh in Naphtali, and Deborah sent word for him to come and talk with her. When he arrived, she said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Judg-4-6">I have a message for you from the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God of Israel! You are to get together an army of 10,000 men from the Naphtali and Zebulun tribes and lead them to Mount Tabor. </span> <span class="text Judg-4-7" id="en-CEV-5490"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will trick Sisera into coming out to fight you at the Kishon River. Sisera will be leading King Jabin's army as usual, and they will have their chariots, but the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has promised to help you defeat them.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-4-8" id="en-CEV-5491"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>“I'm not going unless you go!” Barak told her.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-4-9" id="en-CEV-5492"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>“All right, I'll go!” she replied. “But I'm warning you that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> is going to let a woman defeat Sisera, and no one will honor you for winning the battle.”</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-4-9">Deborah and Barak left for Kedesh, </span> <span class="text Judg-4-10" id="en-CEV-5493"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>where Barak called together the troops from Zebulun and Naphtali. Ten thousand soldiers gathered there, and Barak led them out from Kedesh. Deborah went too.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-4-11" id="en-CEV-5494"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>At this time, Heber of the Kenite clan was living near the village of Oak in Zaanannim,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5494b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5494b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5494b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> not far from Kedesh. The Kenites were descendants of Hobab, the father-in-law of Moses, but Heber had moved and had set up his tents away from the rest of the clan.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-4-12" id="en-CEV-5495"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>When Sisera learned that Barak had led an army to Mount Tabor, </span> <span class="text Judg-4-13" id="en-CEV-5496"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>he called his troops together and got all 900 iron chariots ready. Then he led his army away from Harosheth-Ha-Goiim to the Kishon River.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-4-14" id="en-CEV-5497"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Deborah shouted, “Barak, it's time to attack Sisera! Because today the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> is going to help you defeat him. In fact, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has already gone on ahead to fight for you.”</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-4-14">Barak led his 10,000 troops down from Mount Tabor. </span> <span class="text Judg-4-15" id="en-CEV-5498"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>And during the battle, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> confused Sisera, his chariot drivers, and his whole army. Everyone was so afraid of Barak and his army, that even Sisera jumped down from his chariot and tried to escape. </span> <span class="text Judg-4-16" id="en-CEV-5499"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Barak's forces went after Sisera's chariots and army as far as Harosheth-Ha-Goiim.</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-4-16">Sisera's entire army was wiped out. </span> <span class="text Judg-4-17" id="en-CEV-5500"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Only Sisera escaped. He ran to Heber's camp, because Heber and his family had a peace treaty with the king of Hazor. Sisera went to the tent that belonged to Jael, Heber's wife. </span> <span class="text Judg-4-18" id="en-CEV-5501"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>She came out to greet him and said, “Come in, sir! Please come on in. Don't be afraid.”</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-4-18">After they had gone inside, Sisera lay down, and Jael covered him with a blanket. </span> <span class="text Judg-4-19" id="en-CEV-5502"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>“Could I have a little water?” he asked. “I'm thirsty.”</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-4-19">Jael opened a leather bottle and poured him some milk, then she covered him back up.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-4-20" id="en-CEV-5503"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>“Stand at the entrance to the tent,” Sisera told her. “If someone comes by and asks if anyone is inside, tell them ‘No.’ ”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-4-21" id="en-CEV-5504"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Sisera was exhausted and soon fell fast asleep. Jael took a hammer and drove a tent-peg through his head into the ground, and he died.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-4-22" id="en-CEV-5505"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Meanwhile, Barak had been following Sisera, and Jael went out to meet him. “The man you're looking for is inside,” she said. “Come in and I'll show him to you.”</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-4-22">They went inside, and there was Sisera—dead and stretched out with a tent-peg through his skull.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-4-23" id="en-CEV-5506"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>That same day God defeated the Canaanite King Jabin while the Israelites looked on, and his army was no longer powerful enough to attack the Israelites. </span> <span class="text Judg-4-24" id="en-CEV-5507"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>Jabin grew weaker while the Israelites kept growing stronger, until at last the Israelites destroyed him.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
