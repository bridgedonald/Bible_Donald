<h3><span class="text Judg-13-1" id="en-CEV-5751">Samson Is Born</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Judg-13-1"><span class="chapternum">13 </span>Once again the Israelites started disobeying the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>. So he let the Philistines take control of Israel for 40 years.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-13-2" id="en-CEV-5752"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Manoah from the tribe of Dan lived in the town of Zorah. His wife was not able to have children, </span> <span class="text Judg-13-3-Judg-13-5" id="en-CEV-5753"><sup class="versenum">3-5 </sup> but one day an angel from the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> appeared to her and said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Judg-13-3-Judg-13-5">You have never been able to have any children, but very soon you will be pregnant and have a son. He will belong to God<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5753a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5753a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5753a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> from the day he is born, so his hair must never be cut. And even before he is born, you must not drink any wine or beer or eat any food forbidden by God's laws.</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Judg-13-3-Judg-13-5">Your son will begin to set Israel free from the Philistines.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-13-6" id="en-CEV-5754"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>She went to Manoah and said, “A prophet who looked like an angel of God came and talked to me. I was so frightened, that I didn't even ask where he was from. He didn't tell me his name, </span> <span class="text Judg-13-7" id="en-CEV-5755"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>but he did say that I'm going to have a baby boy. I'm not supposed to drink any wine or beer or eat any food forbidden by God's laws. Our son will belong to God for as long as he lives.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-13-8" id="en-CEV-5756"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Then Manoah prayed, “Our <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, please send that prophet again and let him tell us what to do for the son we are going to have.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-13-9" id="en-CEV-5757"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>God answered Manoah's prayer, and the angel went back to Manoah's wife while she was resting in the fields. Manoah wasn't there at the time, </span> <span class="text Judg-13-10" id="en-CEV-5758"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>so she found him and said, “That same man is here again! He's the one I saw the other day.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-13-11" id="en-CEV-5759"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Manoah went with his wife and asked the man, “Are you the one who spoke to my wife?”</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-13-11">“Yes, I am,” he answered.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-13-12" id="en-CEV-5760"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Manoah then asked, “When your promise comes true, what rules must he obey and what will be his work?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-13-13" id="en-CEV-5761"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>“Your wife must be careful to do everything I told her,” the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s angel answered. </span> <span class="text Judg-13-14" id="en-CEV-5762"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>“She must not eat or drink anything made from grapes. She must not drink wine or beer or eat anything forbidden by God's laws. I told her exactly what to do.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-13-15" id="en-CEV-5763"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>“Please,” Manoah said, “stay here with us for just a little while, and we'll fix a young goat for you to eat.” </span> <span class="text Judg-13-16" id="en-CEV-5764"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Manoah didn't realize that he was really talking to one of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s angels.</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-13-16">The angel answered, “I can stay for a little while, although I won't eat any of your food. But if you would like to offer the goat as a sacrifice to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, that would be fine.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-13-17" id="en-CEV-5765"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Manoah said, “Tell us your name, so we can honor you after our son is born.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-13-18" id="en-CEV-5766"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>“No,” the angel replied. “You don't need to know my name. And if you did, you couldn't understand it.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-13-19" id="en-CEV-5767"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>So Manoah took a young goat over to a large rock he had chosen for an altar, and he built a fire on the rock. Then he killed the goat, and offered it with some grain as a sacrifice to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>. But then an amazing thing happened. </span> <span class="text Judg-13-20" id="en-CEV-5768"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>The fire blazed up toward the sky, and the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s angel went up toward heaven in the fire. Manoah and his wife bowed down low when they saw what happened.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-13-21" id="en-CEV-5769"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Although the angel didn't appear to them again, they realized he was one of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s angels. </span> <span class="text Judg-13-22" id="en-CEV-5770"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Manoah said, “We have seen an angel.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5770b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5770b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5770b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> Now we're going to die.”<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5770c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5770c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5770c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-13-23" id="en-CEV-5771"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>“The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> isn't going to kill us,” Manoah's wife responded. “The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> accepted our sacrifice and grain offering, and he let us see something amazing. Besides, he told us that we're going to have a son.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-13-24" id="en-CEV-5772"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>Later, Manoah's wife did give birth to a son, and she named him Samson. As the boy grew, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> blessed him. </span> <span class="text Judg-13-25" id="en-CEV-5773"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Then, while Samson was staying at Dan's Camp<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5773d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5773d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5773d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> between the towns of Zorah and Eshtaol, the Spirit of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> took control of him.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
