The Midianites stole food, sheep, cattle, and donkeys. Like a swarm of locusts,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5542a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5542a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5542a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> they could not be counted, and they ruined the land wherever they went.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-6-6-Judg-6-7" id="en-CEV-5543"><sup class="versenum">6-7 </sup>The Midianites took almost everything that belonged to the Israelites, and the Israelites begged the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> for help. </span> <span class="text Judg-6-8-Judg-6-9" id="en-CEV-5544"><sup class="versenum">8-9 </sup>Then the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> sent a prophet to them with this message:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Judg-6-8-Judg-6-9">I am the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God of Israel, so listen to what I say. You were slaves in Egypt, but I set you free and led you out of Egypt into this land.

Joash's son Gideon was nearby, threshing grain in a shallow pit, where he could not be seen by the Midianites.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-6-12" id="en-CEV-5547"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>The angel appeared and spoke to Gideon, “The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> is helping you, and you are a strong warrior.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-6-13" id="en-CEV-5548"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Gideon answered, “Please don't take this wrong, but if the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> is helping us, then why have all of these awful things happened? We've heard how the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> performed miracles and rescued our ancestors from Egypt. But those things happened long ago. Now the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has abandoned us to the Midianites.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-6-14" id="en-CEV-5549"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Then the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> himself said, “Gideon, you will be strong, because I am giving you the power to rescue Israel from the Midianites.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-6-15" id="en-CEV-5550"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Gideon replied, “But how can I rescue Israel?

Defeating the Midianites will be as easy as beating up one man.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-6-17" id="en-CEV-5552"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Gideon said, “It's hard to believe that I'm actually talking to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>.

Next, he opened a big sack of flour and made it into thin bread.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5554b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5554b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5554b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> When the meat was done, he put it in a basket and poured the broth into a clay cooking pot.

You're not going to die.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-6-24" id="en-CEV-5559"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>Gideon built an altar for worshiping the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> and called it “The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> Calms Our Fears.” It still stands there in Ophrah, a town in the territory of the Abiezer clan.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Judg-6-25" id="en-CEV-5560">Gideon Tears Down Baal's Altar</span></h3><p><span class="text Judg-6-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>That night the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> spoke to Gideon again:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Judg-6-25">Get your father's second-best bull, the one that's seven years old.

But since Gideon was afraid of his family and the other people in Ophrah, he did it all at night.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-6-28" id="en-CEV-5563"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>When the people of the town got up the next morning, they saw that Baal's altar had been knocked over, and the sacred pole next to it had been cut down. Then they noticed the new altar covered with the remains of the sacrificed bull.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-6-29" id="en-CEV-5564"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>“Who could have done such a thing?” they asked. And they kept on asking, until finally someone told them, “Gideon the son of Joash did it.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-6-30" id="en-CEV-5565"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>The men of the town went to Joash and said, “Your son Gideon knocked over Baal's altar and cut down the sacred pole next to it. Hand him over, so we can kill him!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-6-31" id="en-CEV-5566"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>The crowd pushed closer and closer, but Joash replied, “Are you trying to take revenge for Baal? Are you trying to rescue Baal? If you are, you will be the ones who are put to death, and it will happen before another day dawns. If Baal really is a god, let him take his own revenge on someone who tears down his altar.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-6-32" id="en-CEV-5567"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>That same day, Joash changed Gideon's name to Jerubbaal, explaining, “He tore down Baal's altar, so let Baal take revenge himself.”<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5567e" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5567e" title="See footnote e"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5567e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup></span></p> <h3><span class="text Judg-6-33" id="en-CEV-5568">Gideon Defeats the Midianites</span></h3><p><span class="text Judg-6-33"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>All the Midianites, Amalekites, and other eastern nations got together and crossed the Jordan River. Then they invaded the land of Israel and set up camp in Jezreel Valley.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-6-34" id="en-CEV-5569"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s Spirit took control of Gideon, and Gideon blew a trumpet as a signal for the men in the Abiezer clan to follow him. </span> <span class="text Judg-6-35" id="en-CEV-5570"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>He also sent messengers to the tribes of Manasseh, Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, telling the men of these tribes to come and join his army. Then they set out toward the enemy camp.</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-6-36-Judg-6-37" id="en-CEV-5571"><sup class="versenum">36-37 </sup>Gideon prayed to God, “I know that you promised to help me rescue Israel, but I need proof. Tonight I'll spread a sheep skin on the stone floor of that threshing-place over there. If you really will help me rescue Israel, then tomorrow morning let there be dew on the skin, but let the stone floor be dry.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-6-38" id="en-CEV-5572"><sup class="versenum">38 </sup>And that's just what happened. Early the next morning, Gideon got up and checked the sheep skin. He squeezed out enough water to fill a bowl. </span> <span class="text Judg-6-39" id="en-CEV-5573"><sup class="versenum">39 </sup>But Gideon prayed to God again. “Don't be angry with me,” Gideon said. “Let me try this just one more time, so I'll really be sure you'll help me. Only this time, let the skin be dry and the stone floor be wet.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Judg-6-40" id="en-CEV-5574"><sup class="versenum">40 </sup>That night, God made the stone floor wet with dew, but he kept the sheep skin dry.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
