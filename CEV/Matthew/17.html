They went up on a very high mountain where they could be alone. </span> <span class="text Matt-17-2" id="en-CEV-21667"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>There in front of the disciples, Jesus was completely changed. His face was shining like the sun, and his clothes became white as light.</span></p> <p><span class="text Matt-17-3" id="en-CEV-21668"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>All at once Moses and Elijah were there talking with Jesus. </span> <span class="text Matt-17-4" id="en-CEV-21669"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>So Peter said to him, “Lord, it is good for us to be here! Let us make three shelters, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Matt-17-5" id="en-CEV-21670"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup> While Peter was still speaking, the shadow of a bright cloud passed over them. From the cloud a voice said, “This is my own dear Son, and I am pleased with him. Listen to what he says!” </span> <span class="text Matt-17-6" id="en-CEV-21671"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>When the disciples heard the voice, they were so afraid they fell flat on the ground. </span> <span class="text Matt-17-7" id="en-CEV-21672"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>But Jesus came over and touched them. He said, “Get up and don't be afraid!” </span> <span class="text Matt-17-8" id="en-CEV-21673"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>When they opened their eyes, they saw only Jesus.</span></p> <p><span class="text Matt-17-9" id="en-CEV-21674"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>On their way down from the mountain, Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone what they had seen until after the Son of Man had been raised from death.</span></p> <p><span class="text Matt-17-10" id="en-CEV-21675"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup> The disciples asked Jesus, “Don't the teachers of the Law of Moses say Elijah must come before the Messiah does?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Matt-17-11" id="en-CEV-21676"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup> Jesus told them, “Elijah certainly will come and get everything ready. </span> <span class="text Matt-17-12" id="en-CEV-21677"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup> In fact, he has already come. But the people did not recognize him and treated him just as they wanted to. They will soon make the Son of Man suffer in the same way.” </span> <span class="text Matt-17-13" id="en-CEV-21678"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Then the disciples understood Jesus was talking to them about John the Baptist.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Matt-17-14" id="en-CEV-21679">Jesus Heals a Boy</span></h3><h4 class="reference"><span class="text Matt-17-14">(<a class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Mark.9.14-Mark.9.29" href="/passage/?search=Mark.9.14-Mark.9.29&amp;version=CEV">Mark 9.14-29</a>; <a class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Luke.9.37-Luke.9.43a" href="/passage/?search=Luke.9.37-Luke.9.43a&amp;version=CEV">Luke 9.37-43a</a>)</span></h4><p><span class="text Matt-17-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Jesus and his disciples returned to the crowd. A man knelt in front of him </span> <span class="text Matt-17-15" id="en-CEV-21680"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>and said, “Lord, have pity on my son! He has a bad case of epilepsy and often falls into a fire or into water. </span> <span class="text Matt-17-16" id="en-CEV-21681"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>I brought him to your disciples, but none of them could heal him.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Matt-17-17" id="en-CEV-21682"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Jesus said, “You people are too stubborn to have any faith!
