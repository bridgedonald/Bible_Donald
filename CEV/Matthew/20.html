<h3><span class="text Matt-20-1" id="en-CEV-21756">Workers in a Vineyard</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Matt-20-1"><span class="chapternum">20 </span>As Jesus was telling what the kingdom of heaven would be like, he said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Matt-20-1">Early one morning a man went out to hire some workers for his vineyard. </span> <span class="text Matt-20-2" id="en-CEV-21757"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>After he had agreed to pay them the usual amount for a day's work, he sent them off to his vineyard.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Matt-20-3" id="en-CEV-21758"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>About nine that morning, the man saw some other people standing in the market with nothing to do. </span> <span class="text Matt-20-4" id="en-CEV-21759"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>He promised to pay them what was fair, if they would work in his vineyard. </span> <span class="text Matt-20-5" id="en-CEV-21760"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>So they went.</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Matt-20-5">At noon and again about three in the afternoon he returned to the market. And each time he made the same agreement with others who were loafing around with nothing to do.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Matt-20-6" id="en-CEV-21761"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Finally, about five in the afternoon the man went back and found some others standing there. He asked them, “Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?”</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Matt-20-7" id="en-CEV-21762"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>“Because no one has hired us,” they answered. Then he told them to go work in his vineyard.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Matt-20-8" id="en-CEV-21763"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup> That evening the owner of the vineyard told the man in charge of the workers to call them in and give them their money. He also told the man to begin with the ones who were hired last. </span> <span class="text Matt-20-9" id="en-CEV-21764"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>When the workers arrived, the ones who had been hired at five in the afternoon were given a full day's pay.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Matt-20-10" id="en-CEV-21765"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>The workers who had been hired first thought they would be given more than the others. But when they were given the same, </span> <span class="text Matt-20-11" id="en-CEV-21766"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>they began complaining to the owner of the vineyard. </span> <span class="text Matt-20-12" id="en-CEV-21767"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>They said, “The ones who were hired last worked for only one hour. But you paid them the same that you did us. And we worked in the hot sun all day long!”</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Matt-20-13" id="en-CEV-21768"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>The owner answered one of them, “Friend, I didn't cheat you. I paid you exactly what we agreed on. </span> <span class="text Matt-20-14" id="en-CEV-21769"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Take your money now and go! What business is it of yours if I want to pay them the same that I paid you? </span> <span class="text Matt-20-15" id="en-CEV-21770"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Why should you be jealous, if I want to be generous?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Matt-20-16" id="en-CEV-21771"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup> Jesus then said, “So it is. Everyone who is now last will be first, and everyone who is first will be last.”</span></p> <h3><span class="text Matt-20-17" id="en-CEV-21772">Jesus Again Tells about His Death</span></h3><h4 class="reference"><span class="text Matt-20-17">(<a class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Mark.10.32-Mark.10.34" href="/passage/?search=Mark.10.32-Mark.10.34&amp;version=CEV">Mark 10.32-34</a>; <a class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Luke.18.31-Luke.18.34" href="/passage/?search=Luke.18.31-Luke.18.34&amp;version=CEV">Luke 18.31-34</a>)</span></h4><p><span class="text Matt-20-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>As Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem, he took his twelve disciples aside and told them in private:</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Matt-20-18" id="en-CEV-21773"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>We are now on our way to Jerusalem, where the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses.
