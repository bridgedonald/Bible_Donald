But God's good news isn't locked in jail, </span> <span class="text 2Tim-2-10" id="en-CEV-27724"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>and so I am willing to put up with anything. Then God's special people will be saved and given eternal glory because they belong to Christ Jesus. </span> <span class="text 2Tim-2-11" id="en-CEV-27725"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Here is a true message:</span></p><div class="poetry"><p class="line"><span class="text 2Tim-2-11">“If we died with Christ,</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text 2Tim-2-11">we will live with him.</span></span><br/><span class="text 2Tim-2-12" id="en-CEV-27726"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup> If we don't give up,</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text 2Tim-2-12">we will rule with him.</span></span><br/><span class="text 2Tim-2-12">If we deny</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text 2Tim-2-12">that we know him,</span></span><br/><span class="text 2Tim-2-12">he will deny</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text 2Tim-2-12">that he knows us.</span></span><br/><span class="text 2Tim-2-13" id="en-CEV-27727"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>If we are not faithful,</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text 2Tim-2-13">he will still be faithful.</span></span><br/><span class="text 2Tim-2-13">Christ cannot deny</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text 2Tim-2-13">who he is.”</span></span></p></div> <h3><span class="text 2Tim-2-14" id="en-CEV-27728">An Approved Worker</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Tim-2-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Don't let anyone forget these things.

In fact, they ruin everyone who listens to them. </span> <span class="text 2Tim-2-15" id="en-CEV-27729"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Do your best to win God's approval as a worker who doesn't need to be ashamed and who teaches only the true message.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Tim-2-16" id="en-CEV-27730"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Keep away from worthless and useless talk.
