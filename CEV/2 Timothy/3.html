<h3><span class="text 2Tim-3-1" id="en-CEV-27741">What People Will Be Like in the Last Days</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text 2Tim-3-1"><span class="chapternum">3 </span>You can be certain that in the last days there will be some very hard times. </span> <span class="text 2Tim-3-2" id="en-CEV-27742"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>People will love only themselves and money. They will be proud, stuck-up, rude, and disobedient to their parents. They will also be ungrateful, godless, </span> <span class="text 2Tim-3-3" id="en-CEV-27743"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>heartless, and hateful. Their words will be cruel, and they will have no self-control or pity. These people will hate everything good. </span> <span class="text 2Tim-3-4" id="en-CEV-27744"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>They will be sneaky, reckless, and puffed up with pride. Instead of loving God, they will love pleasure. </span> <span class="text 2Tim-3-5" id="en-CEV-27745"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Even though they will make a show of being religious, their religion won't be real. Don't have anything to do with such people.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Tim-3-6" id="en-CEV-27746"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Some men fool whole families, just to get power over those women who are slaves of sin and are controlled by all sorts of desires. </span> <span class="text 2Tim-3-7" id="en-CEV-27747"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>These women always want to learn something new, but they never can discover the truth. </span> <span class="text 2Tim-3-8" id="en-CEV-27748"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup> Just as Jannes and Jambres<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27748a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27748a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27748a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> opposed Moses, these people are enemies of the truth. Their minds are sick, and their faith isn't real. </span> <span class="text 2Tim-3-9" id="en-CEV-27749"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>But they won't get very far with their foolishness. Soon everyone will know the truth about them, just as Jannes and Jambres were found out.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 2Tim-3-10" id="en-CEV-27750">Paul's Last Instructions to Timothy</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Tim-3-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Timothy, you know what I teach and how I live. You know what I want to do and what I believe. You have seen how patient and loving I am, and how in the past I put up with </span> <span class="text 2Tim-3-11" id="en-CEV-27751"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup> trouble and suffering in the cities of Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. Yet the Lord rescued me from all those terrible troubles. </span> <span class="text 2Tim-3-12" id="en-CEV-27752"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>In fact, anyone who belongs to Christ Jesus and wants to live right will have trouble from others. </span> <span class="text 2Tim-3-13" id="en-CEV-27753"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>But evil people who pretend to be what they are not will become worse than ever, as they fool others and are fooled themselves.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Tim-3-14" id="en-CEV-27754"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Keep on being faithful to what you were taught and to what you believed. After all, you know who taught you these things. </span> <span class="text 2Tim-3-15" id="en-CEV-27755"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Since childhood, you have known the Holy Scriptures that are able to make you wise enough to have faith in Christ Jesus and be saved. </span> <span class="text 2Tim-3-16" id="en-CEV-27756"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Everything in the Scriptures is God's Word. All of it is useful for teaching and helping people and for correcting them and showing them how to live. </span> <span class="text 2Tim-3-17" id="en-CEV-27757"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>The Scriptures train God's servants to do all kinds of good deeds.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
