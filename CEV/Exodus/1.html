Altogether, Jacob had 70 children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-1384a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-1384a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-1384a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> who went with him.</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-1-6" id="en-CEV-1385"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>After Joseph, his brothers, and everyone else in that generation had died, </span> <span class="text Exod-1-7" id="en-CEV-1386"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup> the people of Israel became so numerous that the whole region of Goshen was full of them.</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-1-8" id="en-CEV-1387"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup> Many years later a new king came to power. He did not know what Joseph had done for Egypt, </span> <span class="text Exod-1-9" id="en-CEV-1388"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>and he told the Egyptians:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Exod-1-9">There are too many of those Israelites in our country, and they are becoming more powerful than we are. </span> <span class="text Exod-1-10" id="en-CEV-1389"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup> If we don't outsmart them, their families will keep growing larger. And if our country goes to war, they could easily fight on the side of our enemies and escape from Egypt.</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-1-11" id="en-CEV-1390"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>The Egyptians put slave bosses in charge of the people of Israel and tried to wear them down with hard work.

The Egyptians were cruel to the people of Israel and forced them to make bricks and to mix mortar and to work in the fields.</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-1-15" id="en-CEV-1394"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Finally, the king called in Shiphrah and Puah, the two women who helped the Hebrew<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-1394d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-1394d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-1394d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> mothers when they gave birth. </span> <span class="text Exod-1-16" id="en-CEV-1395"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>He told them, “If a Hebrew woman gives birth to a girl, let the child live.
