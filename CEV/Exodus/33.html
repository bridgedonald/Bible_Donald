Now get ready to lead them to the land I promised their ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. </span> <span class="text Exod-33-2-Exod-33-3" id="en-CEV-2244"><sup class="versenum">2-3 </sup>It is a land rich with milk and honey, and I will send an angel to force out those people who live there—the Canaanites, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. But I will not go with my people. They are so rebellious that I would destroy them before they get there.</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-33-4-Exod-33-5" id="en-CEV-2245"><sup class="versenum">4-5 </sup>Even before the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said these harsh things, he had told Moses, “These people really are rebellious, and I would kill them at once, if I went with them. But tell them to take off their fancy jewelry, then I'll decide what to do with them.” So the people started mourning, </span> <span class="text Exod-33-6" id="en-CEV-2246"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>and after leaving Mount Sinai,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-2246a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-2246a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-2246a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> they stopped wearing fancy jewelry.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Exod-33-7" id="en-CEV-2247">The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> Is with His People</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-33-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Moses used to set up a tent far from camp. He called it the “meeting tent,” and whoever needed some message from the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> would go there. </span> <span class="text Exod-33-8" id="en-CEV-2248"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Each time Moses went out to this tent, everyone would stand at the entrance to their own tents and watch him enter. </span> <span class="text Exod-33-9-Exod-33-11" id="en-CEV-2249"><sup class="versenum">9-11 </sup>Then they would bow down because a thick cloud would come down in front of the tent, and the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> would speak to Moses face to face, just like a friend. Afterwards, Moses would return to camp, but his young assistant Joshua<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-2249b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-2249b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-2249b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> would stay at the tent.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Exod-33-12" id="en-CEV-2250">The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> Promises To Be with His People</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-33-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Moses said to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, “I know that you have told me to lead these people to the land you promised them. But you have not said who will go along to help me. You have said that you are my friend and that you are pleased with me. </span> <span class="text Exod-33-13" id="en-CEV-2251"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>If this is true, let me know what your plans are, then I can obey and continue to please you. And don't forget that you have chosen this nation to be your own.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-33-14" id="en-CEV-2252"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said, “I will go with you and give you peace.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-33-15" id="en-CEV-2253"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Then Moses replied, “If you aren't going with us, please don't make us leave this place. </span> <span class="text Exod-33-16" id="en-CEV-2254"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>But if you do go with us, everyone will know that you are pleased with your people and with me. That way, we will be different from the rest of the people on earth.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-33-17" id="en-CEV-2255"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>So the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> told him, “I will do what you have asked, because I am your friend and I am pleased with you.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-33-18" id="en-CEV-2256"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Then Moses said, “I pray that you will let me see you in all of your glory.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-33-19" id="en-CEV-2257"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup> The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> answered:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Exod-33-19">All right.
