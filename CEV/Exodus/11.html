Then the king will gladly let you leave his land. In fact, he will even chase you out. </span> <span class="text Exod-11-2" id="en-CEV-1646"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Now go and tell my people to ask their Egyptian neighbors for gold and silver jewelry.</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-11-3" id="en-CEV-1647"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>So the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> made the Egyptians greatly respect the Israelites, and everyone, including the king's officials, considered Moses an important leader.</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-11-4" id="en-CEV-1648"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Moses went to the king and said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Exod-11-4">I have come to let you know what the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> is going to do.

Your own son will die, and so will the son of the lowest slave woman. Even the first-born males of your cattle will die. </span> <span class="text Exod-11-6" id="en-CEV-1650"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Everywhere in Egypt there will be loud crying. Nothing like this has ever happened before or will ever happen again.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Exod-11-7" id="en-CEV-1651"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>But there won't be any need for the Israelites to cry. Things will be so quiet that not even a dog will be heard barking.
