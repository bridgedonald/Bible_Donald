Bring along Aaron, as well as his two sons Nadab and Abihu, and 70 of Israel's leaders. They must worship me at a distance, </span> <span class="text Exod-24-2" id="en-CEV-2005"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>but you are to come near. Don't let anyone else come up.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-24-3" id="en-CEV-2006"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Moses gave the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s instructions to the people, and they all promised, “We will do everything the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has commanded!” </span> <span class="text Exod-24-4" id="en-CEV-2007"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Then Moses wrote down what the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had said.</span></p><p><span class="text Exod-24-4">The next morning Moses got up early. He built an altar at the foot of the mountain and set up a large stone for each of the twelve tribes of Israel. </span> <span class="text Exod-24-5" id="en-CEV-2008"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>He also sent some young men to burn offerings and to sacrifice bulls as special offerings<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-2008a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-2008a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-2008a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>. </span> <span class="text Exod-24-6" id="en-CEV-2009"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Moses put half of the blood from the animals into bowls and sprinkled the rest on the altar. </span> <span class="text Exod-24-7" id="en-CEV-2010"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Then he read aloud the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s commands and promises, and the people shouted, “We will obey the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> and do everything he has commanded!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-24-8" id="en-CEV-2011"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup> Moses took the blood from the bowls and sprinkled it on the people. Next, he told them, “With this blood the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> makes his agreement with you.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-24-9" id="en-CEV-2012"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Moses and Aaron, together with Nadab and Abihu and the 70 leaders, went up the mountain </span> <span class="text Exod-24-10" id="en-CEV-2013"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>and saw the God of Israel. Under his feet was something that looked like a pavement made out of sapphire,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-2013b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-2013b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-2013b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> and it was as bright as the sky.</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-24-11" id="en-CEV-2014"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Even though these leaders of Israel saw God, he did not punish them. So they ate and drank.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Exod-24-12" id="en-CEV-2015">Moses on Mount Sinai</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-24-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Come up on the mountain and stay here for a while. I will give you the two flat stones on which I have written the laws that my people must obey.” </span> <span class="text Exod-24-13" id="en-CEV-2016"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Moses and Joshua his assistant got ready, then Moses started up the mountain to meet with God.</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-24-14" id="en-CEV-2017"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Moses had told the leaders, “Wait here until we come back. Aaron and Hur will be with you, and they can settle any arguments while we are away.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-24-15" id="en-CEV-2018"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>When Moses went up on Mount Sinai, a cloud covered it, </span> <span class="text Exod-24-16" id="en-CEV-2019"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>and the bright glory of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> came down and stayed there. The cloud covered the mountain for six days, and on the seventh day the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> told Moses to come into the cloud. </span> <span class="text Exod-24-17-Exod-24-18" id="en-CEV-2020"><sup class="versenum">17-18 </sup> Moses did so and stayed there 40 days and nights. To the people, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s glory looked like a blazing fire on top of the mountain.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
