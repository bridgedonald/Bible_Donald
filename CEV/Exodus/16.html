That's how I will see if they obey me. </span> <span class="text Exod-16-5" id="en-CEV-1785"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>But on the sixth day of each week they must gather and cook twice as much.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-16-6" id="en-CEV-1786"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Moses and Aaron told the people, “This evening you will know that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> was the one who rescued you from Egypt. </span> <span class="text Exod-16-7" id="en-CEV-1787"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>And in the morning you will see his glorious power, because he has heard your complaints against him. Why should you grumble to us? Who are we?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-16-8" id="en-CEV-1788"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Then Moses continued, “You will know it is the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> when he gives you meat each evening and more than enough bread each morning. He is really the one you are complaining about, not us—we are nobodies—but the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has heard your complaints.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-16-9" id="en-CEV-1789"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Moses turned to Aaron and said, “Bring the people together, because the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has heard their complaints.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-16-10" id="en-CEV-1790"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Aaron was speaking to them, when everyone looked out toward the desert and saw the bright glory of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> in a cloud. </span> <span class="text Exod-16-11" id="en-CEV-1791"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, </span> <span class="text Exod-16-12" id="en-CEV-1792"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>“I have heard my people complain. Now tell them that each evening they will have meat and each morning they will have more than enough bread.

Some gathered more and some gathered less. </span> <span class="text Exod-16-18" id="en-CEV-1798"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup> Everyone had exactly what they needed, just the right amount.</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-16-19" id="en-CEV-1799"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Moses told them not to keep any overnight. </span> <span class="text Exod-16-20" id="en-CEV-1800"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Some of them disobeyed, but the next morning what they kept was stinking and full of worms, and Moses was angry.</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-16-21" id="en-CEV-1801"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Each morning everyone gathered as much as they needed, and in the heat of the day the rest melted. </span> <span class="text Exod-16-22" id="en-CEV-1802"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>However, on the sixth day of the week, everyone gathered enough to have four liters, instead of two. When the leaders reported this to Moses, </span> <span class="text Exod-16-23" id="en-CEV-1803"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup> he told them that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had said, “Tomorrow is the Sabbath, a sacred day of rest in honor of me. So gather all you want to bake or boil, and make sure you save enough for tomorrow.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-16-24" id="en-CEV-1804"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>The people obeyed, and the next morning the food smelled fine and had no worms. </span> <span class="text Exod-16-25" id="en-CEV-1805"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>“You may eat the food,” Moses said. “Today is the Sabbath in honor of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, and there won't be any of this food on the ground today. </span> <span class="text Exod-16-26" id="en-CEV-1806"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>You will find it there for the first six days of the week, but not on the Sabbath.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-16-27" id="en-CEV-1807"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>A few of the Israelites did go out to look for some, but there was none. </span> <span class="text Exod-16-28" id="en-CEV-1808"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>Then the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said, “Moses, how long will you people keep disobeying my laws and teachings? </span> <span class="text Exod-16-29" id="en-CEV-1809"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>Remember that I was the one who gave you the Sabbath. That's why on the sixth day I provide enough bread for two days. Everyone is to stay home and rest on the Sabbath.” </span> <span class="text Exod-16-30" id="en-CEV-1810"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>And so they rested on the Sabbath.</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-16-31" id="en-CEV-1811"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup> The Israelites called the bread manna.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-1811d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-1811d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-1811d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> It was white like coriander seed and delicious as wafers made with honey. </span> <span class="text Exod-16-32" id="en-CEV-1812"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>Moses told the people that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had said, “Store up two liters of this manna, because I want future generations to see the food I gave you during the time you were in the desert after I rescued you from Egypt.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-16-33" id="en-CEV-1813"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup> Then Moses told Aaron, “Put some manna in a jar and store it in the place of worship for future generations to see.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-16-34" id="en-CEV-1814"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>Aaron followed the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s instructions and put the manna in front of the sacred chest for safekeeping. </span> <span class="text Exod-16-35-Exod-16-36" id="en-CEV-1815"><sup class="versenum">35-36 </sup> The Israelites ate manna for 40 years, before they came to the border of Canaan that was a settled land.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-1815e" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-1815e" title="See footnote e"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-1815e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup></span></p> <div class="footnotes">
