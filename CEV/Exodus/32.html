<h3><span class="text Exod-32-1" id="en-CEV-2209">The People Make an Idol To Worship</span></h3><h4 class="reference"><span class="text Exod-32-1">(<a class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Deut.9.6-Deut.9.29" href="/passage/?search=Deut.9.6-Deut.9.29&amp;version=CEV">Deuteronomy 9.6-29</a>)</span></h4><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Exod-32-1"><span class="chapternum">32 </span> After the people saw that Moses had been on the mountain for a long time, they went to Aaron and said, “Make us an image of a god who will lead and protect us. Moses brought us out of Egypt, but nobody knows what has happened to him.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-32-2" id="en-CEV-2210"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Aaron told them, “Bring me the gold earrings that your wives and sons and daughters are wearing.” </span> <span class="text Exod-32-3" id="en-CEV-2211"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Everybody took off their earrings and brought them to Aaron, </span> <span class="text Exod-32-4" id="en-CEV-2212"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup> then he melted them and made an idol in the shape of a young bull.</span></p><p><span class="text Exod-32-4">All the people said to one another, “This is the god who brought us out of Egypt!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-32-5" id="en-CEV-2213"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>When Aaron saw what was happening, he built an altar in front of the idol and said, “Tomorrow we will celebrate in honor of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>.” </span> <span class="text Exod-32-6" id="en-CEV-2214"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup> The people got up early the next morning and killed some animals to be used for sacrifices and others to be eaten. Then everyone ate and drank so much that they began to carry on like wild people.</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-32-7" id="en-CEV-2215"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Exod-32-7">Hurry back down! Those people you led out of Egypt are acting like fools. </span> <span class="text Exod-32-8" id="en-CEV-2216"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>They have already stopped obeying me and have made themselves an idol in the shape of a young bull. They have bowed down to it, offered sacrifices, and said that it is the god who brought them out of Egypt. </span> <span class="text Exod-32-9" id="en-CEV-2217"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Moses, I have seen how stubborn these people are, </span> <span class="text Exod-32-10" id="en-CEV-2218"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>and I'm angry enough to destroy them, so don't try to stop me. But I will make your descendants into a great nation.</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-32-11" id="en-CEV-2219"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup> Moses tried to get the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God to change his mind:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Exod-32-11">Our <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, you used your mighty power to bring these people out of Egypt. Now don't become angry and destroy them. </span> <span class="text Exod-32-12" id="en-CEV-2220"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>If you do, the Egyptians will say that you brought your people out here into the mountains just to get rid of them. Please don't be angry with your people. Don't destroy them!</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Exod-32-13" id="en-CEV-2221"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup> Remember the solemn promise you made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. You promised that someday they would have as many descendants as there are stars in the sky and that you would give them land.</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-32-14" id="en-CEV-2222"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>So even though the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had threatened to destroy the people, he changed his mind and let them live.</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-32-15-Exod-32-16" id="en-CEV-2223"><sup class="versenum">15-16 </sup>Moses went back down the mountain with the two flat stones on which God had written all of his laws with his own hand, using both sides of the stones.</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-32-17" id="en-CEV-2224"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>When Joshua heard the noisy shouts of the people, he said to Moses, “A battle must be going on down in the camp.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-32-18" id="en-CEV-2225"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>But Moses replied, “It doesn't sound like they are shouting because they have won or lost a battle. It sounds more like a wild party!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-32-19" id="en-CEV-2226"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>As Moses got closer to the camp, he saw the idol, and he also saw the people dancing around. This made him so angry that he threw down the stones and broke them to pieces at the foot of the mountain. </span> <span class="text Exod-32-20" id="en-CEV-2227"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>He melted the idol the people had made, and he ground it into powder. He scattered it in their water and made them drink it. </span> <span class="text Exod-32-21" id="en-CEV-2228"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Moses asked Aaron, “What did these people do to harm you? Why did you make them sin in this terrible way?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-32-22" id="en-CEV-2229"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Aaron answered:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Exod-32-22">Don't be angry with me. You know as well as I do that they are determined to do evil. </span> <span class="text Exod-32-23" id="en-CEV-2230"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>They even told me, “That man Moses led us out of Egypt, but now we don't know what has happened to him. Make us a god to lead us.” </span> <span class="text Exod-32-24" id="en-CEV-2231"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>Then I asked them to bring me their gold earrings. They took them off and gave them to me. I threw the gold into a fire, and out came this bull.</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-32-25" id="en-CEV-2232"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Moses knew that the people were out of control and that it was Aaron's fault. And now they had made fools of themselves in front of their enemies. </span> <span class="text Exod-32-26" id="en-CEV-2233"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>So Moses stood at the gate of the camp and shouted, “Everyone who is on the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s side come over here!”</span></p><p><span class="text Exod-32-26">Then the men of the Levi tribe gathered around Moses, </span> <span class="text Exod-32-27" id="en-CEV-2234"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>and he said to them, “The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God of Israel commands you to strap on your swords and go through the camp, killing your relatives, your friends, and your neighbors.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-32-28" id="en-CEV-2235"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>The men of the Levi tribe followed his orders, and that day they killed about 3,000 men. </span> <span class="text Exod-32-29" id="en-CEV-2236"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>Moses said to them, “You obeyed the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> and did what was right, and so you will serve as his priests for the people of Israel. It was hard for you to kill your own sons and brothers, but the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has blessed you and made you his priests today.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-32-30" id="en-CEV-2237"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>The next day Moses told the people, “This is a terrible thing you have done. But I will go back to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> to see if I can do something to keep this sin from being held against you.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-32-31" id="en-CEV-2238"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>Moses returned to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> and said, “The people have committed a terrible sin. They have made a gold idol to be their god. </span> <span class="text Exod-32-32" id="en-CEV-2239"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup> But I beg you to forgive them. If you don't, please wipe my name out of your book.”<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-2239a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-2239a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-2239a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-32-33" id="en-CEV-2240"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> replied, “I will wipe out of my book the name of everyone who has sinned against me. </span> <span class="text Exod-32-34" id="en-CEV-2241"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>Now take my people to the place I told you about, and my angel will lead you. But when the time comes, I will punish them for this sin.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-32-35" id="en-CEV-2242"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>So the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> punished the people of Israel with a terrible disease for talking Aaron into making the gold idol.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
