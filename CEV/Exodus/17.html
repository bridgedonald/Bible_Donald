<h3><span class="text Exod-17-1" id="en-CEV-1816">The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> Gives Water from a Rock</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Exod-17-1"><span class="chapternum">17 </span> The Israelites left the desert and moved from one place to another each time the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> ordered them to. Once they camped at Rephidim,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-1816a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-1816a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-1816a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> but there was no water for them to drink.</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-17-2" id="en-CEV-1817"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>The people started complaining to Moses, “Give us some water!”</span></p><p><span class="text Exod-17-2">Moses replied, “Why are you complaining to me and trying to put the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> to the test?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-17-3" id="en-CEV-1818"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>But the people were thirsty and kept on complaining, “Moses, did you bring us out of Egypt just to let us and our families and our animals die of thirst?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-17-4" id="en-CEV-1819"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Then Moses prayed to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, “What am I going to do with these people? They are about to stone me to death!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-17-5" id="en-CEV-1820"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> answered, “Take some of the leaders with you and go ahead of the rest of the people. Also take along the walking stick with which you struck the Nile River. </span> <span class="text Exod-17-6" id="en-CEV-1821"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>When you get to the rock at Mount Sinai,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-1821b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-1821b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-1821b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> I will be there with you. Strike the rock with the stick, and water will pour out for the people to drink.” Moses did this while the leaders watched.</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-17-7" id="en-CEV-1822"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>The people had complained and tested the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> by asking, “Is the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> really with us?” So Moses named that place Massah, which means “testing” and Meribah, which means “complaining.”</span></p> <h3><span class="text Exod-17-8" id="en-CEV-1823">Israel Defeats the Amalekites</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-17-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>When the Israelites were at Rephidim, they were attacked by the Amalekites. </span> <span class="text Exod-17-9" id="en-CEV-1824"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>So Moses told Joshua, “Have some men ready to attack the Amalekites tomorrow. I will stand on a hilltop, holding this walking stick that has the power of God.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-17-10" id="en-CEV-1825"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Joshua led the attack as Moses had commanded, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur stood on the hilltop. </span> <span class="text Exod-17-11" id="en-CEV-1826"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>The Israelites out-fought the Amalekites as long as Moses held up his arms, but they started losing whenever he lowered them. </span> <span class="text Exod-17-12" id="en-CEV-1827"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>After a while, his arms were so tired that Aaron and Hur got a rock for him to sit on. Then they stood beside him and supported his arms in the same position until sunset. </span> <span class="text Exod-17-13" id="en-CEV-1828"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>That's how Joshua defeated the Amalekites.</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-17-14" id="en-CEV-1829"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup> Afterwards, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Write an account of this victory and read it to Joshua. I want the Amalekites to be forgotten forever.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-17-15" id="en-CEV-1830"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Moses built an altar and named it “The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> Gives Me Victory.” </span> <span class="text Exod-17-16" id="en-CEV-1831"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Then Moses explained, “This is because I depended on the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-1831c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-1831c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-1831c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> But in future generations, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will fight the Amalekites again and again.”</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
