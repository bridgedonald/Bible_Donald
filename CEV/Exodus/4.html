<h3><span class="text Exod-4-1" id="en-CEV-1447">The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> Gives Great Power to Moses</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Exod-4-1"><span class="chapternum">4 </span>Moses asked the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, “Suppose everyone refuses to listen to my message, and no one believes that you really appeared to me?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-4-2" id="en-CEV-1448"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> answered, “What's that in your hand?”</span></p><p><span class="text Exod-4-2">“A walking stick,” Moses replied.</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-4-3" id="en-CEV-1449"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>“Throw it down!” the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> commanded. So Moses threw the stick on the ground. It immediately turned into a snake, and Moses jumped back.</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-4-4" id="en-CEV-1450"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>“Pick it up by the tail!” the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> told him. And when Moses did this, the snake turned back into a walking stick.</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-4-5" id="en-CEV-1451"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>“Do this,” the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said, “and the Israelites will believe that you have seen me, the God who was worshiped by their ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-4-6" id="en-CEV-1452"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Next, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> commanded Moses, “Put your hand inside your shirt.” Moses obeyed, and when he took it out, his hand had turned white as snow—like someone with leprosy.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-1452a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-1452a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-1452a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-4-7" id="en-CEV-1453"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>“Put your hand back inside your shirt,” the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> told him. Moses did so, and when he took it out again, it was as healthy as the rest of his body.</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-4-8-Exod-4-9" id="en-CEV-1454"><sup class="versenum">8-9 </sup>Then the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said, “If no one believes either of these miracles, take some water from the Nile River and pour it on the ground. The water will immediately turn into blood.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-4-10" id="en-CEV-1455"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Moses replied, “I have never been a good speaker. I wasn't one before you spoke to me, and I'm not one now. I am slow at speaking, and I can never think of what to say.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-4-11" id="en-CEV-1456"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>But the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> answered, “Who makes people able to speak or makes them deaf or unable to speak? Who gives them sight or makes them blind? Don't you know that I am the one who does these things? </span> <span class="text Exod-4-12" id="en-CEV-1457"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Now go! When you speak, I will be with you and give you the words to say.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-4-13" id="en-CEV-1458"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Moses begged, “<span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, please send someone else to do it.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-4-14" id="en-CEV-1459"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> became angry with Moses and said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Exod-4-14">What about your brother Aaron, the Levite? I know he is a good speaker. He is already on his way here to visit you, and he will be happy to see you again. </span> <span class="text Exod-4-15-Exod-4-16" id="en-CEV-1460"><sup class="versenum">15-16 </sup>Aaron will speak to the people for you, and you will be like me, telling Aaron what to say. I will be with both of you as you speak, and I will tell each of you what to do. </span> <span class="text Exod-4-17" id="en-CEV-1461"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Now take this walking stick and use it to perform miracles.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Exod-4-18" id="en-CEV-1462">Moses Returns to Egypt</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-4-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Moses went to his father-in-law Jethro and asked, “Please let me return to Egypt to see if any of my people are still alive.”</span></p><p><span class="text Exod-4-18">“All right,” Jethro replied. “I hope all goes well.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-4-19" id="en-CEV-1463"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>But even before this, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had told Moses, “Leave the land of Midian and return to Egypt. Everyone who wanted to kill you is now dead.” </span> <span class="text Exod-4-20" id="en-CEV-1464"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>So Moses put his wife and sons on donkeys and headed for Egypt, holding the walking stick that had the power of God.</span></p> <p><span class="text Exod-4-21" id="en-CEV-1465"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>On the way the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Exod-4-21">When you get to Egypt, go to the king and work the miracles I have shown you. But I will make him so stubborn that he will refuse to let my people go. </span> <span class="text Exod-4-22" id="en-CEV-1466"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Then tell him that I have said, “Israel is my first-born son, </span> <span class="text Exod-4-23" id="en-CEV-1467"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup> and I commanded you to release him, so he could worship me. But you refused, and now I will kill your first-born son.”</span></p> <h3><span class="text Exod-4-24" id="en-CEV-1468">Zipporah's Son Is Circumcised</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-4-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>One night while Moses was in camp, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> was about to kill him. </span> <span class="text Exod-4-25" id="en-CEV-1469"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>But Zipporah<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-1469b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-1469b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-1469b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> circumcised her son with a flint knife.
