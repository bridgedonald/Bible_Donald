Then God doesn't let you enjoy it, and someone you don't even know gets it all. That's senseless and terribly unfair!</span></p> <p><span class="text Eccl-6-3" id="en-CEV-15612"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>You may live a long time and have a hundred children. But a child born dead is better off than you, unless you enjoy life and have a decent burial. </span> <span class="text Eccl-6-4-Eccl-6-5" id="en-CEV-15613"><sup class="versenum">4-5 </sup>That child will never live to see the sun or to have a name, and it will go straight to the world of darkness. But it will still find more rest than you, </span> <span class="text Eccl-6-6" id="en-CEV-15614"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>even if you live two thousand years and don't enjoy life. As you know, we all end up in the same place.</span></p> <p><span class="text Eccl-6-7" id="en-CEV-15615"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>We struggle just to have enough to eat, but we are never satisfied. </span> <span class="text Eccl-6-8" id="en-CEV-15616"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>We may be sensible, yet we are no better off than a fool. And if we are poor, it still doesn't do us any good to try to live right. </span> <span class="text Eccl-6-9" id="en-CEV-15617"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>It's better to enjoy what we have than to always want something else, because that makes no more sense than chasing the wind.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-15617a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-15617a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-15617a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text Eccl-6-10" id="en-CEV-15618"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Everything that happens was decided long ago.
