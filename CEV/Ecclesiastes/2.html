<h3><span class="text Eccl-2-1" id="en-CEV-15526">It Is Senseless To Be Selfish</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Eccl-2-1"><span class="chapternum">2 </span>I said to myself, “Have fun and enjoy yourself!” But this didn't make sense. </span> <span class="text Eccl-2-2" id="en-CEV-15527"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Laughing and having fun is crazy. What good does it do? </span> <span class="text Eccl-2-3" id="en-CEV-15528"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>I wanted to find out what was best for us during the short time we have on this earth. So I decided to make myself happy with wine and find out what it means to be foolish, without really being foolish myself.</span></p> <p><span class="text Eccl-2-4" id="en-CEV-15529"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup> I did some great things. I built houses and planted vineyards. </span> <span class="text Eccl-2-5" id="en-CEV-15530"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>I had flower gardens and orchards full of fruit trees. </span> <span class="text Eccl-2-6" id="en-CEV-15531"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>And I had pools where I could get water for the trees. </span> <span class="text Eccl-2-7" id="en-CEV-15532"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup> I owned slaves, and their sons and daughters became my slaves. I had more sheep and goats than anyone who had ever lived in Jerusalem. </span> <span class="text Eccl-2-8" id="en-CEV-15533"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup> Foreign rulers brought me silver, gold, and precious treasures. Men and women sang for me, and I had many wives<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-15533a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-15533a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-15533a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> who gave me great pleasure.</span></p> <p><span class="text Eccl-2-9" id="en-CEV-15534"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup> I was the most famous person who had ever lived in Jerusalem, and I was very wise. </span> <span class="text Eccl-2-10" id="en-CEV-15535"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>I got whatever I wanted and did whatever made me happy. But most of all, I enjoyed my work. </span> <span class="text Eccl-2-11" id="en-CEV-15536"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Then I thought about everything I had done, including the hard work, and it was simply chasing the wind.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-15536b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-15536b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-15536b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> Nothing on earth is worth the trouble.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Eccl-2-12" id="en-CEV-15537">Wisdom Comes from God</span></h3><p><span class="text Eccl-2-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>I asked myself, “What can the next king do that I haven't done?” Then I decided to compare wisdom with foolishness and stupidity. </span> <span class="text Eccl-2-13" id="en-CEV-15538"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>And I discovered that wisdom is better than foolishness, just as light is better than darkness. </span> <span class="text Eccl-2-14" id="en-CEV-15539"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Wisdom is like having two good eyes; foolishness leaves you in the dark. But wise or foolish, we all end up the same.</span></p> <p><span class="text Eccl-2-15" id="en-CEV-15540"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Finally, I said to myself, “Being wise got me nowhere! The same thing will happen to me that happens to fools. Nothing makes sense. </span> <span class="text Eccl-2-16" id="en-CEV-15541"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Wise or foolish, we all die and are soon forgotten.” </span> <span class="text Eccl-2-17" id="en-CEV-15542"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>This made me hate life. Everything we do is painful; it's just as senseless as chasing the wind.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-15542c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-15542c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-15542c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text Eccl-2-18" id="en-CEV-15543"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Suddenly I realized that others would someday get everything I had worked for so hard, then I started hating it all. </span> <span class="text Eccl-2-19" id="en-CEV-15544"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Who knows if those people will be sensible or stupid? Either way, they will own everything I have earned by hard work and wisdom. It doesn't make sense.</span></p> <p><span class="text Eccl-2-20" id="en-CEV-15545"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>I thought about all my hard work, and I felt depressed. </span> <span class="text Eccl-2-21" id="en-CEV-15546"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>When we use our wisdom, knowledge, and skill to get what we own, why do we have to leave it to someone who didn't work for it? This is senseless and wrong. </span> <span class="text Eccl-2-22" id="en-CEV-15547"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>What do we really gain from all of our hard work? </span> <span class="text Eccl-2-23" id="en-CEV-15548"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup> Our bodies ache during the day, and work is torture. Then at night our thoughts are troubled. It just doesn't make sense.</span></p> <p><span class="text Eccl-2-24" id="en-CEV-15549"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup> The best thing we can do is to enjoy eating, drinking, and working.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-15549d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-15549d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-15549d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> I believe these are God's gifts to us, </span> <span class="text Eccl-2-25" id="en-CEV-15550"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>and no one enjoys eating and living more than I do. </span> <span class="text Eccl-2-26" id="en-CEV-15551"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup> If we please God, he will make us wise, understanding, and happy. But if we sin, God will make us struggle for a living, then he will give all we own to someone who pleases him. This makes no more sense than chasing the wind.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-15551e" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-15551e" title="See footnote e"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-15551e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup></span></p> <div class="footnotes">
