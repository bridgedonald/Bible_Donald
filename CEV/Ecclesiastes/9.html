<h3><span class="text Eccl-9-1" id="en-CEV-15667">One Day at a Time</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Eccl-9-1"><span class="chapternum">9 </span>I thought about these things. Then I understood that God has power over everyone, even those who are wise and live right. Anything can happen to any one of us, and so we never know if life will be good or bad.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-15667a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-15667a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-15667a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Eccl-9-2" id="en-CEV-15668"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>But exactly<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-15668b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-15668b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-15668b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> the same thing will finally happen to all of us, whether we live right and respect God or sin and don't respect God. Yes, the same thing will happen if we offer sacrifices to God or if we don't, if we keep our promises or are afraid to make them.</span></p> <p><span class="text Eccl-9-3" id="en-CEV-15669"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>It's terribly unfair for the same thing to happen to each of us. We are mean and foolish while we live, and then we die. </span> <span class="text Eccl-9-4" id="en-CEV-15670"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>As long as we are alive, we still have hope, just as a live dog is better off than a dead lion. </span> <span class="text Eccl-9-5" id="en-CEV-15671"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>We know we will die, but the dead don't know a thing. Nothing good will happen to them—they are gone and forgotten. </span> <span class="text Eccl-9-6" id="en-CEV-15672"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Their loves, their hates, and their jealous feelings have all disappeared with them. They will never again take part in anything that happens on this earth.</span></p> <p><span class="text Eccl-9-7" id="en-CEV-15673"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>So be happy and enjoy eating and drinking! God decided long ago that this is what you should do. </span> <span class="text Eccl-9-8" id="en-CEV-15674"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Dress up, comb your hair, and look your best. </span> <span class="text Eccl-9-9" id="en-CEV-15675"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Life is short, and you love your wife, so enjoy being with her. This is what you are supposed to do as you struggle through life on this earth. </span> <span class="text Eccl-9-10" id="en-CEV-15676"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Work hard at whatever you do. You will soon go to the world of the dead, where no one works or thinks or reasons or even knows anything.</span></p> <p><span class="text Eccl-9-11" id="en-CEV-15677"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Here is something else I have learned:</span></p><div class="poetry"><p class="line"><span class="text Eccl-9-11">The fastest runners</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Eccl-9-11">and the greatest heroes</span></span><br/><span class="text Eccl-9-11">don't always win races</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Eccl-9-11">and battles.</span></span><br/><span class="text Eccl-9-11">Wisdom, intelligence, and skill</span><br/><span class="text Eccl-9-11">don't always make you healthy,</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Eccl-9-11">rich, or popular.</span></span><br/><span class="text Eccl-9-11">We each have our own share</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Eccl-9-11">of misfortune.</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1"><span class="text Eccl-9-12" id="en-CEV-15678"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>None of us know when we might fall victim to a sudden disaster and find ourselves like fish in a net or birds in a trap.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Eccl-9-13" id="en-CEV-15679">Better To Be Wise than Foolish</span></h3><p><span class="text Eccl-9-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Once I saw what people really think of wisdom, and it made an impression on me. </span> <span class="text Eccl-9-14" id="en-CEV-15680"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>It happened when a powerful ruler surrounded and attacked a small city where only a few people lived.
