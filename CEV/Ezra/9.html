<h3><span class="text Ezra-9-1" id="en-CEV-10520">Ezra Condemns Mixed Marriages</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Ezra-9-1"><span class="chapternum">9 </span>Later the Jewish leaders came to me<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-10520a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-10520a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-10520a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> and said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezra-9-1">Many Israelites, including priests and Levites, are living just like the people around them. They are even guilty of some of the horrible sins of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezra-9-2" id="en-CEV-10521"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Some Israelite men have married foreign women and have let their sons do the same thing. Our own officials and leaders were the first to commit this disgusting sin, and now God's holy people are mixed with foreigners.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezra-9-3" id="en-CEV-10522"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>This news made me so angry that I ripped my clothes and tore hair from my head and beard. Then I just sat in shock </span> <span class="text Ezra-9-4" id="en-CEV-10523"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>until the time for the evening sacrifice. Many of our people were greatly concerned and gathered around me, because the God of Israel had warned us to stay away from foreigners.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Ezra-9-5" id="en-CEV-10524">Ezra's Prayer</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezra-9-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>At the time of the evening sacrifice, I was still sitting there in sorrow with my clothes all torn. So I got down on my knees, then lifted my arms, </span> <span class="text Ezra-9-6" id="en-CEV-10525"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>and prayed:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezra-9-6">I am much too ashamed to face you, <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God. Our sins and our guilt have swept over us like a flood that reaches up to the heavens. </span> <span class="text Ezra-9-7" id="en-CEV-10526"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Since the time of our ancestors, all of us have sinned. That's why we, our kings, and our priests have often been defeated by other kings. They have killed some of us and made slaves of others; they have taken our possessions and made us ashamed, just as we are today.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezra-9-8" id="en-CEV-10527"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>But for now, <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God, you have shown great kindness to us. You made us truly happy by letting some of us settle in this sacred place and by helping us in our time of slavery. </span> <span class="text Ezra-9-9" id="en-CEV-10528"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>We are slaves, but you have never turned your back on us. You love us, and because of you, the kings of Persia have helped us. It's as though you have given us new life! You let us rebuild your temple and live safely in Judah and Jerusalem.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezra-9-10" id="en-CEV-10529"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Our God, what can we say now? Even after all this, we have disobeyed the commands </span> <span class="text Ezra-9-11" id="en-CEV-10530"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>that were given to us by your servants the prophets. They said the land you are giving us is full of sinful and wicked people, who never stop doing disgusting things.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-10530b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-10530b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-10530b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Ezra-9-12" id="en-CEV-10531"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup> And we were warned not to let our daughters and sons marry their sons and daughters.</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezra-9-12">Your prophets also told us never to help those foreigners or even let them live in peace. You wanted us to become strong and to enjoy the good things in the land, then someday to leave it to our children forever.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezra-9-13" id="en-CEV-10532"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>You punished us because of our terrible sins. But you did not punish us nearly as much as we deserve, and you have brought some of us back home. </span> <span class="text Ezra-9-14" id="en-CEV-10533"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Why should we disobey your commands again by letting our sons and daughters marry these foreigners who do such disgusting things? That would make you angry enough to destroy us all! </span> <span class="text Ezra-9-15" id="en-CEV-10534"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup><span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God of Israel, you have been more than fair by letting a few of us survive. But once again, our sins have made us ashamed to face you.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
