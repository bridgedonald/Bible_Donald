<h3><span class="text Ezra-10-1" id="en-CEV-10535">The Plan for Ending Mixed Marriages</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Ezra-10-1"><span class="chapternum">10 </span>While Ezra was down on his knees in front of God's temple, praying with tears in his eyes and confessing the sins of the people of Israel, a large number of men, women, and children gathered around him and cried bitterly.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezra-10-2" id="en-CEV-10536"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Shecaniah son of Jehiel from the family of Elam said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezra-10-2">Ezra, we have disobeyed God by marrying these foreign women. But there is still hope for the people of Israel, </span> <span class="text Ezra-10-3" id="en-CEV-10537"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>if we follow your advice and the advice of others who truly respect the laws of God. We must promise God that we will divorce our foreign wives and send them away, together with their children.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezra-10-4" id="en-CEV-10538"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Ezra, it's up to you to do something! We will support whatever you do. So be brave!</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezra-10-5" id="en-CEV-10539"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Ezra stood up and made the chief priests, the Levites, and everyone else in Israel swear that they would follow the advice of Shecaniah. </span> <span class="text Ezra-10-6" id="en-CEV-10540"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Then Ezra left God's temple and went to spend the night in the living quarters of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. He felt sorry because of what the people had done, and he did not eat or drink a thing.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezra-10-7-Ezra-10-8" id="en-CEV-10541"><sup class="versenum">7-8 </sup>The officials and leaders sent a message to all who had returned from Babylonia and were now living in Jerusalem and Judah. This message told them to meet in Jerusalem within three days, or else they would lose everything they owned and would no longer be considered part of the people that had returned from Babylonia.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezra-10-9" id="en-CEV-10542"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Three days later, on the twentieth day of the ninth month,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-10542a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-10542a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-10542a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> everyone from Judah and Benjamin came to Jerusalem and sat in the temple courtyard. It was a serious meeting, and they sat there, trembling in the rain.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezra-10-10" id="en-CEV-10543"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Ezra the priest stood up and said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezra-10-10">You have broken God's Law by marrying foreign women, and you have made the whole nation guilty! </span> <span class="text Ezra-10-11" id="en-CEV-10544"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Now you must confess your sins to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God of your ancestors and obey him. Divorce your foreign wives and don't have anything to do with the rest of the foreigners who live around here.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezra-10-12" id="en-CEV-10545"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Everyone in the crowd shouted:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezra-10-12">You're right! We will do what you say. </span> <span class="text Ezra-10-13" id="en-CEV-10546"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>But there are so many of us, and we can't just stay out here in this downpour. A lot of us have sinned by marrying foreign women, and the matter can't be settled in only a day or two.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezra-10-14" id="en-CEV-10547"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Why can't our officials stay on in Jerusalem and take care of this for us? Let everyone who has sinned in this way meet here at a certain time with leaders and judges from their own towns. If we take care of this problem, God will surely stop being so terribly angry with us.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezra-10-15" id="en-CEV-10548"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah were the only ones who objected, except for the two Levites, Meshullam and Shabbethai.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezra-10-16" id="en-CEV-10549"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Everyone else who had returned from exile agreed with the plan.
