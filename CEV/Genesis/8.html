So God made a wind blow, and the water started going down. </span> <span class="text Gen-8-2" id="en-CEV-171"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>God stopped up the places where the water had been gushing out from under the earth. He also closed up the sky, and the rain stopped. </span> <span class="text Gen-8-3" id="en-CEV-172"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>For 150 days the water slowly went down. </span> <span class="text Gen-8-4" id="en-CEV-173"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Then on the seventeenth day of the seventh month of the year, the boat came to rest somewhere in the Ararat mountains. </span> <span class="text Gen-8-5" id="en-CEV-174"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>The water kept going down, and the mountain tops could be seen on the first day of the tenth month.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-8-6-Gen-8-7" id="en-CEV-175"><sup class="versenum">6-7 </sup>Forty days later Noah opened a window to send out a raven, but it kept flying around until the water had dried up. </span> <span class="text Gen-8-8" id="en-CEV-176"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Noah wanted to find out if the water had gone down, so he sent out a dove. </span> <span class="text Gen-8-9" id="en-CEV-177"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Deep water was still everywhere, and when the dove could not find a place to land, it flew back to the boat. Then Noah held out his hand and helped it back in.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-8-10" id="en-CEV-178"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Seven days later Noah sent the dove out again. </span> <span class="text Gen-8-11" id="en-CEV-179"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>It returned in the evening, holding in its beak a green leaf from an olive tree. Noah knew the water was finally going down. </span> <span class="text Gen-8-12" id="en-CEV-180"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>He waited seven more days before sending the dove out again, and this time it did not return.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-8-13" id="en-CEV-181"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Noah was now 601 years old.
