<h3><span class="text Gen-48-1" id="en-CEV-1309">Jacob Blesses Joseph's Two Sons</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Gen-48-1"><span class="chapternum">48 </span>Joseph was told that his father Jacob had become very sick. So Joseph went to see him and took along his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. </span> <span class="text Gen-48-2" id="en-CEV-1310"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>When Joseph arrived, someone told Jacob, “Your son Joseph has come to see you.” Jacob sat up in bed, but it took almost all his strength.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-48-3" id="en-CEV-1311"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup> Jacob told Joseph:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-48-3">God All-Powerful appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, where he gave me his blessing </span> <span class="text Gen-48-4" id="en-CEV-1312"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>and promised, “I will give you a large family with many descendants that will grow into a nation. And I am giving you this land that will belong to you and your family forever.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-48-5" id="en-CEV-1313"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Then Jacob went on to say:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-48-5">Joseph, your two sons Ephraim and Manasseh were born in Egypt, but I accept them as my own, just as Reuben and Simeon are mine. </span> <span class="text Gen-48-6" id="en-CEV-1314"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Any children you have later will be considered yours, but their inheritance will come from Ephraim and Manasseh. </span> <span class="text Gen-48-7" id="en-CEV-1315"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup> Unfortunately, your mother Rachel died in Canaan after we had left northern Syria<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-1315a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-1315a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-1315a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> and before we reached Bethlehem.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-1315b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-1315b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-1315b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> And I had to bury her along the way.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-48-8-Gen-48-10" id="en-CEV-1316"><sup class="versenum">8-10 </sup>Jacob was very old and almost blind. He did not recognize the two boys, and so he asked Joseph, “Who are these boys?”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-48-8-Gen-48-10">Joseph answered, “They are my sons. God has given them to me here in Egypt.”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-48-8-Gen-48-10">“Bring them to me,” Jacob said. “I want to give them my blessing.” Joseph brought the boys to him, and he hugged and kissed them.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-48-11" id="en-CEV-1317"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Jacob turned to Joseph and told him, “For many years I thought you were dead and that I would never see you again. But now God has even let me live to see your children.” </span> <span class="text Gen-48-12" id="en-CEV-1318"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Then Joseph made his sons move away from Jacob's knees,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-1318c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-1318c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-1318c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> and Joseph bowed down in front of him with his face to the ground.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-48-13" id="en-CEV-1319"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>After Joseph got up, he brought his two sons over to Jacob again. He led his younger son Ephraim to the left side of Jacob and his older son Manasseh to the right. </span> <span class="text Gen-48-14" id="en-CEV-1320"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>But before Jacob gave them his blessing, he crossed his arms, putting his right hand on the head of Ephraim and his left hand on the head of Manasseh. </span> <span class="text Gen-48-15" id="en-CEV-1321"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Then he gave Joseph his blessing and said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-48-15">My grandfather Abraham and my father Isaac worshiped the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God. He has been with me all my life, </span> <span class="text Gen-48-16" id="en-CEV-1322"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>and his angel has kept me safe. Now I pray that he will bless these boys and that my name and the names of Abraham and Isaac will live on because of them. I ask God to give them many children and many descendants as well.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-48-17" id="en-CEV-1323"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Joseph did not like it when he saw his father place his right hand on the head of the younger son. So he tried to move his father's right hand from Ephraim's head and place it on Manasseh. </span> <span class="text Gen-48-18" id="en-CEV-1324"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Joseph said, “Father, you have made a mistake. This is the older boy. Put your right hand on him.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-48-19" id="en-CEV-1325"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>But his father said, “Son, I know what I am doing. It's true that Manasseh's family will someday become a great nation. But Ephraim will be even greater than Manasseh, because his descendants will become many great nations.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-48-20" id="en-CEV-1326"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup> Jacob told him that in the future the people of Israel would ask God's blessings on one another by saying, “I pray for God to bless you as much as he blessed Ephraim and Manasseh.” Jacob put Ephraim's name first to show that he would be greater than Manasseh. </span> <span class="text Gen-48-21" id="en-CEV-1327"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>After that, Jacob said, “Joseph, you can see that I won't live much longer. But God will be with you and will lead you back to the land he promised our family long ago. </span> <span class="text Gen-48-22" id="en-CEV-1328"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Meanwhile, I'm giving you the hillside<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-1328d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-1328d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-1328d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> I captured from the Amorites.”</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
