<h3><span class="text Gen-20-1" id="en-CEV-428">Abraham and Sarah at Gerar</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Gen-20-1"><span class="chapternum">20 </span>Abraham moved to the Southern Desert, where he settled between Kadesh and Shur. Later he went to Gerar, and while there </span> <span class="text Gen-20-2" id="en-CEV-429"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup> he told everyone that his wife Sarah was his sister. So King Abimelech of Gerar had Sarah brought to him. </span> <span class="text Gen-20-3" id="en-CEV-430"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>But God came to Abimelech in a dream and said, “You have taken a married woman into your home, and for this you will die!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-20-4-Gen-20-5" id="en-CEV-431"><sup class="versenum">4-5 </sup>Abimelech said to the Lord, “Don't kill me! I haven't slept with Sarah. Didn't they say they were brother and sister? I am completely innocent.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-20-6" id="en-CEV-432"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Then God continued:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-20-6">I know you are innocent. That's why I kept you from sleeping with Sarah and doing anything wrong. </span> <span class="text Gen-20-7" id="en-CEV-433"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Her husband is a prophet. Let her go back to him, and his prayers will save you from death. But if you don't return her, you and all your people will die.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-20-8" id="en-CEV-434"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Early the next morning Abimelech sent for his officials, and when he told them what had happened, they were frightened. </span> <span class="text Gen-20-9" id="en-CEV-435"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Abimelech then called in Abraham and said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-20-9">Look what you've done to us! What have I ever done to you? Why did you make me and my nation guilty of such a terrible sin? </span> <span class="text Gen-20-10" id="en-CEV-436"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>What were you thinking when you did this?</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-20-11" id="en-CEV-437"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Abraham answered:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-20-11">I did it because I didn't think any of you respected God, and I was sure that someone would kill me to get my wife. </span> <span class="text Gen-20-12" id="en-CEV-438"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Besides, she is my half sister. We have the same father, but different mothers. </span> <span class="text Gen-20-13" id="en-CEV-439"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>When God made us leave my father's home and start wandering, I told her, “If you really love me, then tell everyone that I am your brother.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-20-14" id="en-CEV-440"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>After Abimelech had given Abraham some sheep, cattle, and slaves, he sent Sarah back </span> <span class="text Gen-20-15" id="en-CEV-441"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>and told Abraham he could settle anywhere in his country. </span> <span class="text Gen-20-16" id="en-CEV-442"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Then he said to Sarah, “I have given your brother 1,000 pieces of silver as proof to everyone that you have done nothing wrong.”<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-442a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-442a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-442a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-20-17-Gen-20-18" id="en-CEV-443"><sup class="versenum">17-18 </sup>Meanwhile, God had kept Abimelech's wife and slaves from having children.
