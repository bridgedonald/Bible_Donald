<h3><span class="text Gen-38-1" id="en-CEV-1002">Judah and Tamar</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Gen-38-1"><span class="chapternum">38 </span>About that time Judah left his brothers in the hill country and went to live near his friend Hirah in the town of Adullam. </span> <span class="text Gen-38-2" id="en-CEV-1003"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>While there he met the daughter of Shua, a Canaanite man. Judah married her, </span> <span class="text Gen-38-3" id="en-CEV-1004"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>and they had three sons. He named the first one Er; </span> <span class="text Gen-38-4" id="en-CEV-1005"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>she named the next one Onan. </span> <span class="text Gen-38-5" id="en-CEV-1006"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>The third one was born when Judah was in Chezib, and she named him Shelah.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-38-6" id="en-CEV-1007"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Later, Judah chose Tamar as a wife for Er, his oldest son. </span> <span class="text Gen-38-7" id="en-CEV-1008"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>But Er was very evil, and the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> took his life. </span> <span class="text Gen-38-8" id="en-CEV-1009"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>So Judah told Onan, “It's your duty to marry Tamar and have a child for your brother.”<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-1009a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-1009a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-1009a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-38-9" id="en-CEV-1010"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Onan knew the child would not be his,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-1010b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-1010b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-1010b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> and when he had sex with Tamar, he made sure that she would not get pregnant. </span> <span class="text Gen-38-10" id="en-CEV-1011"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> wasn't pleased with Onan and took his life too.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-38-11" id="en-CEV-1012"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Judah did not want the same thing to happen to his son Shelah, and he told Tamar, “Go home to your father and live there as a widow until my son Shelah is grown.” So Tamar went to live with her father.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-38-12" id="en-CEV-1013"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Some years later Judah's wife died, and he mourned for her. He then went with his friend Hirah to the town of Timnah, where his sheep were being sheared. </span> <span class="text Gen-38-13" id="en-CEV-1014"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Tamar found out that her father-in-law Judah was going to Timnah to shear his sheep. </span> <span class="text Gen-38-14" id="en-CEV-1015"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>She also realized that Shelah was now a grown man, but she had not been allowed to marry him. So she decided to dress in something other than her widow's clothes and to cover her face with a veil. After this, she sat outside the town of Enaim on the road to Timnah.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-38-15" id="en-CEV-1016"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>When Judah came along, he did not recognize her because of the veil. He thought she was a prostitute </span> <span class="text Gen-38-16" id="en-CEV-1017"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>and asked her to sleep with him. She asked, “What will you give me if I do?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-38-17" id="en-CEV-1018"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>“One of my young goats,” he answered.</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-38-17">“What will you give me to keep until you send the goat?” she asked.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-38-18" id="en-CEV-1019"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>“What do you want?” he asked in return.</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-38-18">“The ring on that cord around your neck,” was her reply. “I also want the special walking stick<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-1019c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-1019c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-1019c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> you have with you.” He gave them to her, they slept together, and she became pregnant.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-38-19" id="en-CEV-1020"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>After returning home, Tamar took off the veil and dressed in her widow's clothes again.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-38-20" id="en-CEV-1021"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Judah asked his friend Hirah take a goat to the woman, so he could get back the ring and walking stick, but she wasn't there. </span> <span class="text Gen-38-21" id="en-CEV-1022"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Hirah asked the people of Enaim, “Where is the prostitute who sat along the road outside your town?”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-38-21">“There's never been one here,” they answered.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-38-22" id="en-CEV-1023"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Hirah went back and told Judah, “I couldn't find the woman, and the people of Enaim said no prostitute had ever been there.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-38-23" id="en-CEV-1024"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>“If you couldn't find her, we'll just let her keep the things I gave her,” Judah answered. “And we'd better forget about the goat, or else we'll look like fools.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-38-24" id="en-CEV-1025"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>About three months later someone told Judah, “Your daughter-in-law Tamar has behaved like a prostitute, and now she's pregnant!”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-38-24">“Drag her out of town and burn her to death!” Judah shouted.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-38-25" id="en-CEV-1026"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>As Tamar was being dragged off, she sent someone to tell her father-in-law, “The man who gave me this ring, this cord, and this walking stick is the one who got me pregnant.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-38-26" id="en-CEV-1027"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>“Those are mine!” Judah admitted. “She's a better person than I am, because I broke my promise to let her marry my son Shelah.” After this, Judah never slept with her again.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-38-27-Gen-38-28" id="en-CEV-1028"><sup class="versenum">27-28 </sup>Tamar later gave birth to twins. But before either of them was born, one of them stuck a hand out of her womb. The woman who was helping tied a red thread around the baby's hand and explained, “This one came out first.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-38-29" id="en-CEV-1029"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>At once his hand went back in, and the other child was born first. The woman then said, “What an opening you've made for yourself!” So they named the baby Perez.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-1029d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-1029d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-1029d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Gen-38-30" id="en-CEV-1030"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>When the brother with the red thread was born, they named him Zerah.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-1030e" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-1030e" title="See footnote e"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-1030e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup></span></p> <div class="footnotes">
