If you obey me and always do right, </span> <span class="text Gen-17-2" id="en-CEV-340"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>I will keep my solemn promise to you and give you more descendants than can be counted.” </span> <span class="text Gen-17-3" id="en-CEV-341"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Abram bowed with his face to the ground, and God said:</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-17-4-Gen-17-5" id="en-CEV-342"><sup class="versenum">4-5 </sup> I promise that you will be the father of many nations.

Some of them will even be kings.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-17-7" id="en-CEV-344"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup> I will always keep the promise I have made to you and your descendants, because I am your God and their God. </span> <span class="text Gen-17-8" id="en-CEV-345"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup> I will give you and them the land in which you are now a foreigner. I will give the whole land of Canaan to your family forever, and I will be their God.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-17-9" id="en-CEV-346"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Abraham, you and all future members of your family must promise to obey me. </span> <span class="text Gen-17-10-Gen-17-11" id="en-CEV-347"><sup class="versenum">10-11 </sup> As the sign that you are keeping this promise, you must circumcise every man and boy in your family. </span> <span class="text Gen-17-12-Gen-17-13" id="en-CEV-348"><sup class="versenum">12-13 </sup>From now on, your family must circumcise every baby boy when he is eight days old.

This will be a sign that my promise to you will last forever. </span> <span class="text Gen-17-14" id="en-CEV-349"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Any man who isn't circumcised hasn't kept his part of the promise and cannot be one of my people.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-17-15" id="en-CEV-350"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Abraham, from now on your wife's name will be Sarah instead of Sarai. </span> <span class="text Gen-17-16" id="en-CEV-351"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>I will bless her, and you will have a son by her. She will become the mother of nations, and some of her descendants will even be kings.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-17-17" id="en-CEV-352"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Abraham bowed with his face to the ground and thought, “I am almost 100 years old. How can I become a father? And Sarah is 90. How can she have a child?” So he started laughing. </span> <span class="text Gen-17-18" id="en-CEV-353"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Then he asked God, “Why not let Ishmael<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-353b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-353b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-353b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> inherit what you have promised me?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-17-19" id="en-CEV-354"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>But God answered:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-17-19">No!
