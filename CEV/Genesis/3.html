<h3><span class="text Gen-3-1" id="en-CEV-56">The First Sin</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Gen-3-1"><span class="chapternum">3 </span> The snake was sneakier than any of the other wild animals that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God had made. One day it came to the woman and asked, “Did God tell you not to eat fruit from any tree in the garden?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-3-2" id="en-CEV-57"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>The woman answered, “God said we could eat fruit from any tree in the garden, </span> <span class="text Gen-3-3" id="en-CEV-58"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>except the one in the middle. He told us not to eat fruit from that tree or even to touch it. If we do, we will die.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-3-4" id="en-CEV-59"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>“No, you won't!” the snake replied. </span> <span class="text Gen-3-5" id="en-CEV-60"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>“God understands what will happen on the day you eat fruit from that tree. You will see what you have done, and you will know the difference between right and wrong, just as God does.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-3-6" id="en-CEV-61"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>The woman stared at the fruit. It looked beautiful and tasty. She wanted the wisdom that it would give her, and she ate some of the fruit. Her husband was there with her, so she gave some to him, and he ate it too. </span> <span class="text Gen-3-7" id="en-CEV-62"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>At once they saw what they had done, and they realized they were naked. Then they sewed fig leaves together to cover themselves.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-3-8" id="en-CEV-63"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Late in the afternoon, when the breeze began to blow, the man and woman heard the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God walking in the garden. So they hid behind some trees.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Gen-3-9" id="en-CEV-64">Sin Brings a Curse</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-3-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>The <span

class="versenum">10 </sup>The man answered, “I was naked, and when I heard you walking through the garden, I was frightened and hid!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-3-11" id="en-CEV-66"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>“How did you know you were naked?” God asked. “Did you eat any fruit from that tree in the middle of the garden?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-3-12" id="en-CEV-67"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>“It was the woman you put here with me,” the man said. “She gave me some of the fruit, and I ate it.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-3-13"
