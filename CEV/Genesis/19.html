<h3><span class="text Gen-19-1" id="en-CEV-392">The Evil City of Sodom</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Gen-19-1"><span class="chapternum">19 </span>That evening, while Lot was sitting near the city gate,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-392a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-392a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-392a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> the two angels<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-392b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-392b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-392b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> arrived in Sodom. When Lot saw them, he got up, bowed down low, </span> <span class="text Gen-19-2" id="en-CEV-393"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>and said, “Gentlemen, I am your servant. Please come to my home. You can wash your feet, spend the night, and be on your way in the morning.”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-19-2">They told him, “No, we'll spend the night in the city square.” </span> <span class="text Gen-19-3" id="en-CEV-394"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>But Lot kept insisting, until they finally agreed and went home with him. He quickly baked some bread,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-394c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-394c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-394c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> cooked a meal, and they ate.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-19-4" id="en-CEV-395"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Before Lot and his guests could go to bed, every man in Sodom, young and old, came and stood outside his house </span> <span class="text Gen-19-5" id="en-CEV-396"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup> and started shouting, “Where are your visitors? Send them out, so we can have sex with them!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-19-6" id="en-CEV-397"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Lot went outside and shut the door behind him. </span> <span class="text Gen-19-7" id="en-CEV-398"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Then he said, “Friends, please don't do such a terrible thing! </span> <span class="text Gen-19-8" id="en-CEV-399"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>I have two daughters who have never had sex. I'll bring them out, and you can do what you want with them. But don't harm these men. They are guests in my home.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-19-9" id="en-CEV-400"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>“Don't get in our way,” the crowd answered. “You're a foreigner. What right do you have to order us around? We'll do worse things to you than we're going to do to them.”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-19-9">The crowd kept arguing with Lot. Finally, they rushed toward the door to break it down. </span> <span class="text Gen-19-10" id="en-CEV-401"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>But the two angels in the house reached out and pulled Lot safely inside. </span> <span class="text Gen-19-11" id="en-CEV-402"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup> Then they struck blind everyone in the crowd, and none of them could even find the door.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-19-12-Gen-19-13" id="en-CEV-403"><sup class="versenum">12-13 </sup>The two angels said to Lot, “The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has heard many terrible things about the people of Sodom, and he has sent us here to destroy the city. Take your family and leave. Take every relative you have in the city, as well as the men your daughters are going to marry.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-19-14" id="en-CEV-404"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Lot went to the men who were engaged to his daughters and said, “Hurry up and get out of here! The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> is going to destroy this city.” But they thought he was joking, and they laughed at him.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-19-15" id="en-CEV-405"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Early the next morning the two angels tried to make Lot hurry and leave. They said, “Take your wife and your two daughters and get away from here as fast as you can! If you don't, every one of you will be killed when the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> destroys the city.” </span> <span class="text Gen-19-16" id="en-CEV-406"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup> At first, Lot just stood there. But the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> wanted to save him. So the angels took Lot, his wife, and his two daughters by the hand and led them out of the city. </span> <span class="text Gen-19-17" id="en-CEV-407"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>When they were outside, one of the angels said, “Run for your lives! Don't even look back. And don't stop in the valley. Run to the hills, where you'll be safe.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-19-18-Gen-19-19" id="en-CEV-408"><sup class="versenum">18-19 </sup>Lot answered, “You have done us a great favor, sir. You have saved our lives, but please don't make us go to the hills. That's too far away. The city will be destroyed before we can get there, and we will be killed when it happens. </span> <span class="text Gen-19-20" id="en-CEV-409"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>There's a town near here. It's only a small place, but my family and I will be safe, if you let us go there.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-19-21" id="en-CEV-410"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>“All right, go there,” he answered. “I won't destroy that town. </span> <span class="text Gen-19-22" id="en-CEV-411"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Hurry! Run! I can't do anything until you are safely there.”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-19-22">The town was later called Zoar<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-411d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-411d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-411d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> because Lot had said it was small.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Gen-19-23" id="en-CEV-412">Sodom and Gomorrah Are Destroyed</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-19-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>The sun was coming up as Lot reached the town of Zoar, </span> <span class="text Gen-19-24" id="en-CEV-413"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup> and the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> sent burning sulfur down like rain on Sodom and Gomorrah. </span> <span class="text Gen-19-25" id="en-CEV-414"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>He destroyed those cities and everyone who lived in them, as well as their land and the trees and grass that grew there.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-19-26" id="en-CEV-415"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup> On the way, Lot's wife looked back and was turned into a block of salt.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-19-27" id="en-CEV-416"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>That same morning Abraham got up and went to the place where he had stood and spoken with the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>. </span> <span class="text Gen-19-28" id="en-CEV-417"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and saw smoke rising from all over the land—it was like a flaming furnace.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-19-29" id="en-CEV-418"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>When God destroyed the cities of the valley where Lot lived, he remembered his promise to Abraham and saved Lot from the terrible destruction.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Gen-19-30" id="en-CEV-419">Moab and Ammon</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-19-30"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>Lot was afraid to stay on in Zoar. So he took his two daughters and moved to a cave in the hill country. </span> <span class="text Gen-19-31" id="en-CEV-420"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>One day his older daughter said to her sister, “Our father is old, and there are no men anywhere for us to marry. </span> <span class="text Gen-19-32" id="en-CEV-421"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>Let's get our father drunk! Then we can sleep with him and have children.” </span> <span class="text Gen-19-33" id="en-CEV-422"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>That night they got their father drunk, and the older daughter got in bed with him, but he was too drunk even to know she was there.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-19-34" id="en-CEV-423"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>The next day the older daughter said to her sister, “I slept with my father last night. We'll get him drunk again tonight, so you can sleep with him, and we can each have a child.” </span> <span class="text Gen-19-35" id="en-CEV-424"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>That night they got their father drunk, and this time the younger sister slept with him. But once again he was too drunk even to know she was there.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-19-36" id="en-CEV-425"><sup class="versenum">36 </sup>That's how Lot's two daughters had children. </span> <span class="text Gen-19-37" id="en-CEV-426"><sup class="versenum">37 </sup>The older daughter named her son Moab,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-426e" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-426e" title="See footnote e"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-426e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> and he is the ancestor of the Moabites. </span> <span class="text Gen-19-38" id="en-CEV-427"><sup class="versenum">38 </sup>The younger daughter named her son Benammi,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-427f" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-427f" title="See footnote f"&gt;f&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-427f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> and he is the ancestor of the Ammonites.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
