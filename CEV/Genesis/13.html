<h3><span class="text Gen-13-1" id="en-CEV-267">Abram and Lot Separate</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Gen-13-1"><span class="chapternum">13 </span>Abram and Sarai took everything they owned and went to the Southern Desert. Lot went with them.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-13-2" id="en-CEV-268"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Abram was very rich. He owned many cattle, sheep, and goats, and had a lot of silver and gold. </span> <span class="text Gen-13-3" id="en-CEV-269"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Abram moved from place to place in the Southern Desert. And finally, he went north and set up his tents between Bethel and Ai, </span> <span class="text Gen-13-4" id="en-CEV-270"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>where he had earlier camped and built an altar. There he worshiped the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-13-5" id="en-CEV-271"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Lot, who was traveling with him, also had sheep, goats, and cattle, as well as his own family and slaves. </span> <span class="text Gen-13-6-Gen-13-7" id="en-CEV-272"><sup class="versenum">6-7 </sup>At this time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were still living in the same area, and so there wasn't enough pastureland left for Abram and Lot with all of their animals. Besides this, the men who took care of Abram's animals and the ones who took care of Lot's animals started quarreling.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-13-8" id="en-CEV-273"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Abram said to Lot, “We are close relatives. We shouldn't argue, and our men shouldn't be fighting one another. </span> <span class="text Gen-13-9" id="en-CEV-274"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>There is plenty of land for you to choose from. Let's separate. If you go north, I'll go south; if you go south, I'll go north.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-13-10" id="en-CEV-275"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup> This happened before the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had destroyed the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. And when Lot looked around, he saw there was plenty of water in the Jordan Valley. All the way to Zoar the valley was as green as the garden of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> or the land of Egypt. </span> <span class="text Gen-13-11" id="en-CEV-276"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>So Lot chose the whole Jordan Valley for himself, and as he started out toward the east, he and Abram separated. </span> <span class="text Gen-13-12" id="en-CEV-277"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Abram stayed in the land of Canaan. But Lot settled near the cities of the valley and put up his tents not far from Sodom, </span> <span class="text Gen-13-13" id="en-CEV-278"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>where the people were evil and sinned terribly against the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Gen-13-14" id="en-CEV-279">Abram Moves to Hebron</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-13-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>After Abram and Lot had gone their separate ways, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to Abram:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-13-14">Look around to the north, south, east, and west. </span> <span class="text Gen-13-15" id="en-CEV-280"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup> I will give you and your family all the land you can see. It will be theirs forever! </span> <span class="text Gen-13-16" id="en-CEV-281"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>I will give you more descendants than there are specks of dust on the earth, and someday it will be easier to count those specks of dust than to count your descendants. </span> <span class="text Gen-13-17" id="en-CEV-282"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Now walk back and forth across the land, because I am going to give it to you.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-13-18" id="en-CEV-283"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Abram took down his tents and went to live near the sacred trees of Mamre at Hebron, where he built an altar in honor of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>.</span></p>  <!--end of crossrefs-->
