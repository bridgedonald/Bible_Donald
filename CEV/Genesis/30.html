That's all you need to give me. </span> <span class="text Gen-30-33" id="en-CEV-768"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>In the future you can easily find out if I've been honest.

And when the others were ready to mate, he made sure that they faced in the direction of the spotted and black ones. In this way, Jacob built up a flock of sheep for himself and did not put them with the other sheep.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-30-41" id="en-CEV-776"><sup class="versenum">41 </sup>When the stronger sheep were mating near the drinking place, Jacob made sure that the spotted branches were there. </span> <span class="text Gen-30-42" id="en-CEV-777"><sup class="versenum">42 </sup>But he would not put out the branches when the weaker animals were mating. So Jacob got all of the healthy animals, and Laban got what was left. </span> <span class="text Gen-30-43" id="en-CEV-778"><sup class="versenum">43 </sup>Jacob soon became rich and successful. He owned many sheep, goats, camels, and donkeys, as well as a lot of slaves.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
