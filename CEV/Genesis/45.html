When he was alone with his brothers, he told them, “I am Joseph.” </span> <span class="text Gen-45-2" id="en-CEV-1234"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Then he cried so loudly that the Egyptians heard him and told about it in the king's<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-1234a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-1234a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-1234a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> palace.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-45-3" id="en-CEV-1235"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Joseph asked his brothers if his father was still alive, but they were too frightened to answer. </span> <span class="text Gen-45-4" id="en-CEV-1236"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Joseph told them to come closer to him, and when they did, he said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-45-4">Yes, I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt. </span> <span class="text Gen-45-5" id="en-CEV-1237"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Don't worry or blame yourselves for what you did. God is the one who sent me ahead of you to save lives.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-45-6" id="en-CEV-1238"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>There has already been a famine for two years, and for five more years no one will plow fields or harvest grain. </span> <span class="text Gen-45-7" id="en-CEV-1239"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>But God sent me on ahead of you to keep your families alive and to save you in this wonderful way. </span> <span class="text Gen-45-8" id="en-CEV-1240"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>After all, you weren't really the ones who sent me here—it was God. He made me the highest official in the king's court and placed me over all Egypt.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-45-9" id="en-CEV-1241"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup> Now hurry back and tell my father that his son Joseph says, “God has made me ruler of Egypt. Come here as quickly as you can. </span> <span class="text Gen-45-10" id="en-CEV-1242"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>You will live near me in the region of Goshen with your children and grandchildren, as well as with your sheep, goats, cattle, and everything else you own. </span> <span class="text Gen-45-11" id="en-CEV-1243"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>I will take care of you there during the next five years of famine. But if you don't come, you and your family and your animals will starve to death.”</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-45-12" id="en-CEV-1244"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>All of you, including my brother Benjamin, can tell by what I have said that I really am Joseph. </span> <span class="text Gen-45-13" id="en-CEV-1245"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Tell my father about my great power here in Egypt and about everything you have seen. Hurry and bring him here.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-45-14" id="en-CEV-1246"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Joseph and Benjamin hugged each other and started crying. </span> <span class="text Gen-45-15" id="en-CEV-1247"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Joseph was still crying as he kissed each of his other brothers. After this, they started talking with Joseph.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-45-16" id="en-CEV-1248"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>When it was told in the palace that Joseph's brothers had come, the king and his officials were happy. </span> <span class="text Gen-45-17" id="en-CEV-1249"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>So the king said to Joseph:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-45-17">Tell your brothers to load their donkeys and return to Canaan. </span> <span class="text Gen-45-18" id="en-CEV-1250"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Tell them to bring their father and their families here. I will give them the best land in Egypt, and they can eat and enjoy everything that grows there. </span> <span class="text Gen-45-19" id="en-CEV-1251"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Also tell your brothers to take some wagons from Egypt for their wives and children to ride in. And be sure they bring their father. </span> <span class="text Gen-45-20" id="en-CEV-1252"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>They can leave their possessions behind, because they will be given the best of everything in Egypt.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-45-21" id="en-CEV-1253"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Jacob's sons agreed to do what the king had said. And Joseph gave them wagons and food for their trip home, just as the king had ordered. </span> <span class="text Gen-45-22" id="en-CEV-1254"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Joseph gave some new clothes to each of his brothers, but to Benjamin he gave five new outfits and 300 pieces of silver. </span> <span class="text Gen-45-23" id="en-CEV-1255"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>To his father he sent ten donkeys loaded with the best things in Egypt, and ten other donkeys loaded with grain and bread and other food for the return trip. </span> <span class="text Gen-45-24" id="en-CEV-1256"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>Then he sent his brothers off and told them, “Don't argue on the way home!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-45-25" id="en-CEV-1257"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Joseph's brothers left Egypt, and when they arrived in Canaan, </span> <span class="text Gen-45-26" id="en-CEV-1258"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>they told their father that Joseph was still alive and was the ruler of Egypt. But their father was so surprised that he could not believe them. </span> <span class="text Gen-45-27" id="en-CEV-1259"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>Then they told him everything Joseph had said.
