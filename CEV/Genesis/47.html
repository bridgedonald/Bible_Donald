They have brought their sheep, goats, cattle, and everything else they own to the region of Goshen.”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-47-1-Gen-47-2">Then he introduced his brothers to the king, </span> <span class="text Gen-47-3" id="en-CEV-1280"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>who asked them, “What do you do for a living?”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-47-3">“Sir, we are shepherds,” was their answer. “Our families have always raised sheep. </span> <span class="text Gen-47-4" id="en-CEV-1281"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>But in our country all the pastures are dried up, and our sheep have no grass to eat. So we, your servants, have come here. Please let us live in the region of Goshen.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-47-5" id="en-CEV-1282"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>The king said to Joseph, “It's good that your father and brothers have arrived. </span> <span class="text Gen-47-6" id="en-CEV-1283"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>I will let them live anywhere they choose in the land of Egypt, but I suggest that they settle in Goshen, the best part of our land. I would also like for your finest shepherds to watch after my own sheep and goats.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-47-7" id="en-CEV-1284"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Then Joseph brought his father Jacob and introduced him to the king. Jacob gave the king his blessing, </span> <span class="text Gen-47-8" id="en-CEV-1285"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>and the king asked him, “How old are you?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-47-9" id="en-CEV-1286"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Jacob answered, “I have lived only 130 years, and I have had to move from place to place. My parents and my grandparents also had to move from place to place. But they lived much longer, and their life was not as hard as mine.” </span> <span class="text Gen-47-10" id="en-CEV-1287"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Then Jacob gave the king his blessing once again and left. </span> <span class="text Gen-47-11" id="en-CEV-1288"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Joseph obeyed the king's orders and gave his father and brothers some of the best land in Egypt near the city of Rameses. </span> <span class="text Gen-47-12" id="en-CEV-1289"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Joseph also provided food for their families.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Gen-47-13" id="en-CEV-1290">A Famine in Egypt</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-47-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>The famine was bad everywhere in Egypt and Canaan, and the people were suffering terribly. </span> <span class="text Gen-47-14" id="en-CEV-1291"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>So Joseph sold them the grain that had been stored up, and he put the money<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-1291a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-1291a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-1291a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> in the king's treasury. </span> <span class="text Gen-47-15" id="en-CEV-1292"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>But when everyone had run out of money, the Egyptians came to Joseph and demanded, “Give us more grain! If you don't, we'll soon be dead, because our money's all gone.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-47-16" id="en-CEV-1293"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>“If you don't have any money,” Joseph answered, “give me your animals, and I'll let you have some grain.” </span> <span class="text Gen-47-17" id="en-CEV-1294"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>From then on, they brought him their horses and donkeys and their sheep and goats in exchange for grain.</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-47-17">Within a year Joseph had collected every animal in Egypt. </span> <span class="text Gen-47-18" id="en-CEV-1295"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Then the people came to him and said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-47-18">Sir, there's no way we can hide the truth from you.
