<h3><span class="text Gen-26-1" id="en-CEV-603">Isaac and Abimelech</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Gen-26-1"><span class="chapternum">26 </span>Once during Abraham's lifetime, the fields had not produced enough grain, and now the same thing happened. So Isaac went to King Abimelech of the Philistines in the land of Gerar, </span> <span class="text Gen-26-2" id="en-CEV-604"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>because the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had appeared to Isaac and said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-26-2">Isaac, stay away from Egypt! I will show you where I want you to go. </span> <span class="text Gen-26-3" id="en-CEV-605"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup> You will live there as a foreigner, but I will be with you and bless you. I will keep my promise to your father Abraham by giving this land to you and your descendants.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-26-4" id="en-CEV-606"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>I will give you as many descendants as there are stars in the sky, and I will give your descendants all of this land. They will be a blessing to every nation on earth,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-606a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-606a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-606a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Gen-26-5" id="en-CEV-607"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>because Abraham did everything I told him to do.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-26-6" id="en-CEV-608"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Isaac moved to Gerar </span> <span class="text Gen-26-7" id="en-CEV-609"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup> with his beautiful wife Rebekah. He was afraid that someone might kill him to get her, and so he told everyone that Rebekah was his sister. </span> <span class="text Gen-26-8" id="en-CEV-610"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>After Isaac had been there a long time, King Abimelech looked out a window and saw Isaac hugging and kissing Rebekah. </span> <span class="text Gen-26-9" id="en-CEV-611"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Abimelech called him in and said, “Rebekah must be your wife! Why did you say she is your sister?”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-26-9">“Because I thought someone would kill me,” Isaac answered.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-26-10" id="en-CEV-612"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>“Don't you know what you've done?” Abimelech exclaimed. “If someone had slept with her, you would have made our whole nation guilty!” </span> <span class="text Gen-26-11" id="en-CEV-613"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Then Abimelech warned his people that anyone who even touched Isaac or Rebekah would be put to death.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-26-12" id="en-CEV-614"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Isaac planted grain and had a good harvest that same year. The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> blessed him, </span> <span class="text Gen-26-13" id="en-CEV-615"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>and Isaac was so successful that he became very rich. </span> <span class="text Gen-26-14" id="en-CEV-616"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>In fact, the Philistines were jealous of the large number of sheep, goats, and slaves that Isaac owned, </span> <span class="text Gen-26-15" id="en-CEV-617"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>and they stopped up the wells that Abraham's servants had dug before his death. </span> <span class="text Gen-26-16" id="en-CEV-618"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Finally, Abimelech said, “Isaac, I want you to leave our country. You have become too powerful to stay here.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-26-17" id="en-CEV-619"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Isaac left and settled in Gerar Valley, </span> <span class="text Gen-26-18" id="en-CEV-620"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>where he cleaned out those wells that the Philistines had stopped up. Isaac also gave each of the wells the same name<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-620b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-620b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-620b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> that Abraham had given to them. </span> <span class="text Gen-26-19" id="en-CEV-621"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>While his servants were digging in the valley, they found a spring-fed well. </span> <span class="text Gen-26-20" id="en-CEV-622"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>But the shepherds of Gerar Valley quarreled with Isaac's shepherds and claimed the water belonged to them. So this well was named “Quarrel,” because they had quarreled with Isaac.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-26-21" id="en-CEV-623"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Isaac's servants dug another well, and the shepherds also quarreled about it. So that well was named “Jealous.” </span> <span class="text Gen-26-22" id="en-CEV-624"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Finally, they dug one more well. There was no quarreling this time, and the well was named “Lots of Room,” because the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had given them room and would make them very successful.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-26-23" id="en-CEV-625"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>Isaac went on to Beersheba, </span> <span class="text Gen-26-24" id="en-CEV-626"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>where the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> appeared to him that night and told him, “Don't be afraid! I am the God who was worshiped by your father Abraham, my servant. I will be with you and bless you, and because of Abraham I will give you many descendants.” </span> <span class="text Gen-26-25" id="en-CEV-627"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Isaac built an altar there and worshiped the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>. Then he set up camp, and his servants started digging a well.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-26-26" id="en-CEV-628"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup> Meanwhile, Abimelech had left Gerar and was taking his advisor Ahuzzath and his army commander Phicol to see Isaac. </span> <span class="text Gen-26-27" id="en-CEV-629"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>When they arrived, Isaac asked, “Why are you here? Didn't you send me away because you hated me?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-26-28" id="en-CEV-630"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>They answered, “We now know for certain that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> is with you, and we have decided there needs to be a peace treaty between you and us. So let's make a solemn agreement </span> <span class="text Gen-26-29" id="en-CEV-631"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>not to harm each other. Remember, we have never hurt you, and when we sent you away, we let you go in peace. The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has truly blessed you.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-26-30" id="en-CEV-632"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>Isaac gave a big feast for them, and everyone ate and drank. </span> <span class="text Gen-26-31" id="en-CEV-633"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>Early the next morning Isaac and the others made a solemn agreement, then he let them go in peace.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-26-32" id="en-CEV-634"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>Later that same day Isaac's servants came and said, “We've struck water!” </span> <span class="text Gen-26-33" id="en-CEV-635"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>So Isaac named the well Shibah,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-635c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-635c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-635c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> and the town is still called Beersheba.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-635d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-635d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-635d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup></span></p> <h3><span class="text Gen-26-34" id="en-CEV-636">Esau's Foreign Wives</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-26-34"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>When Esau was 40 years old, he married Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite. </span> <span class="text Gen-26-35" id="en-CEV-637"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>But these two women brought a lot of grief to Esau's parents Isaac and Rebekah.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
