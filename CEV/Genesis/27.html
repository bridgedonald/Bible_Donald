<h3><span class="text Gen-27-1" id="en-CEV-638">Isaac Blesses Jacob</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Gen-27-1"><span class="chapternum">27 </span>Isaac was old and almost blind, when he called in his first-born son Esau, who asked him, “Father, what can I do for you?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-27-2" id="en-CEV-639"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Isaac replied, “I am old and might die at any time. </span> <span class="text Gen-27-3" id="en-CEV-640"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>So go hunting with your bow and arrows and kill a wild animal. </span> <span class="text Gen-27-4" id="en-CEV-641"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Cook some of that tasty food that I love so much and bring it to me. I want to eat it once more and give you my blessing before I die.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-27-5" id="en-CEV-642"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Rebekah had been listening, and as soon as Esau left to go hunting, </span> <span class="text Gen-27-6" id="en-CEV-643"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>she said to Jacob, “I heard your father tell Esau </span> <span class="text Gen-27-7" id="en-CEV-644"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>to kill a wild animal and cook some tasty food for him before he dies. Your father said this because he wants to bless your brother with the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> as his witness. </span> <span class="text Gen-27-8" id="en-CEV-645"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Now, my son, listen carefully to what I want you to do. </span> <span class="text Gen-27-9" id="en-CEV-646"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Go and kill two of your best young goats and bring them to me. I'll cook the tasty food that your father loves so much. </span> <span class="text Gen-27-10" id="en-CEV-647"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Then you can take it to him, so he can eat it and give you his blessing before he dies.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-27-11" id="en-CEV-648"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>“My brother Esau is a hairy man,” Jacob reminded her. “And I am not. </span> <span class="text Gen-27-12" id="en-CEV-649"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>If my father touches me and realizes I am trying to trick him, he will put a curse on me instead of giving me a blessing.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-27-13" id="en-CEV-650"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Rebekah insisted, “Let his curse fall on me! Just do what I say and bring me the meat.” </span> <span class="text Gen-27-14" id="en-CEV-651"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>So Jacob brought the meat to his mother, and she cooked the tasty food that his father liked. </span> <span class="text Gen-27-15" id="en-CEV-652"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Then she took Esau's best clothes and put them on Jacob. </span> <span class="text Gen-27-16" id="en-CEV-653"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>She also covered the smooth part of his hands and neck with goatskins </span> <span class="text Gen-27-17" id="en-CEV-654"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>and gave him some bread and the tasty food she had cooked.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-27-18" id="en-CEV-655"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Jacob went to his father and said, “Father, here I am.”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-27-18">“Which one of my sons are you?” his father asked.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-27-19" id="en-CEV-656"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Jacob replied, “I am Esau, your first-born, and I have done what you told me. Please sit up and eat the meat I have brought. Then you can give me your blessing.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-27-20" id="en-CEV-657"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Isaac asked, “My son, how did you find an animal so quickly?”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-27-20">“The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> your God was kind to me,” Jacob answered.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-27-21" id="en-CEV-658"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>“My son,” Isaac said, “come closer, where I can touch you and find out if you really are Esau.” </span> <span class="text Gen-27-22" id="en-CEV-659"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Jacob went closer. His father touched him and said, “You sound like Jacob, but your hands feel hairy like Esau's.” </span> <span class="text Gen-27-23" id="en-CEV-660"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>And so Isaac blessed Jacob, thinking he was Esau.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-27-24" id="en-CEV-661"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>Isaac asked, “Are you really my son Esau?”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-27-24">“Yes, I am,” Jacob answered.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-27-25" id="en-CEV-662"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>So Isaac told him, “Serve me the wild meat, and I can give you my blessing.”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-27-25">Jacob gave him some meat, and he ate it. He also gave him some wine, and he drank it. </span> <span class="text Gen-27-26" id="en-CEV-663"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>Then Isaac said, “Son, come over here and kiss me.” </span> <span class="text Gen-27-27" id="en-CEV-664"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup> While Jacob was kissing him, Isaac caught the smell of his clothes and said:</span></p><div class="poetry"><p class="line"><span class="text Gen-27-27">“The smell of my son</span><br/><span class="text Gen-27-27">is like a field</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Gen-27-27">the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has blessed.</span></span><br/><span class="text Gen-27-28" id="en-CEV-665"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>God will bless you, my son,</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Gen-27-28">with dew from heaven</span></span><br/><span class="text Gen-27-28">and with fertile fields,</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Gen-27-28">rich with grain and grapes.</span></span><br/><span class="text Gen-27-29" id="en-CEV-666"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup> Nations will be your servants</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Gen-27-29">and bow down to you.</span></span><br/><span class="text Gen-27-29">You will rule over your brothers,</span><br/><span class="text Gen-27-29">and they will kneel</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Gen-27-29">at your feet.</span></span><br/><span class="text Gen-27-29">Anyone who curses you</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Gen-27-29">will be cursed;</span></span><br/><span class="text Gen-27-29">anyone who blesses you</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Gen-27-29">will be blessed.”</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1"><span class="text Gen-27-30" id="en-CEV-667"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>Right after Isaac had given Jacob his blessing and Jacob had gone, Esau came back from hunting. </span> <span class="text Gen-27-31" id="en-CEV-668"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>He cooked the tasty food, brought it to his father, and said, “Father, please sit up and eat the meat I have brought you, so you can give me your blessing.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-27-32" id="en-CEV-669"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>“Who are you?” Isaac asked.</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-27-32">“I am Esau, your first-born son.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-27-33" id="en-CEV-670"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>Isaac started trembling and said, “Then who brought me some wild meat right before you came in? I ate it and gave him a blessing that cannot be taken back.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-27-34" id="en-CEV-671"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>Esau cried out in great distress, “Father, give me a blessing too!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-27-35" id="en-CEV-672"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>Isaac answered, “Your brother tricked me and stole your blessing.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-27-36" id="en-CEV-673"><sup class="versenum">36 </sup> Esau replied, “My brother deserves the name Jacob,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-673a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-673a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-673a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> because he has already cheated me twice. The first time he cheated me out of my rights as the first-born son, and now he has cheated me out of my blessing.” Then Esau asked his father, “Don't you have any blessing left for me?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-27-37" id="en-CEV-674"><sup class="versenum">37 </sup>“My son,” Isaac answered, “I have made Jacob the ruler over you and your brothers, and all of you will be his servants. I have also promised him all the grain and grapes that he needs. There's nothing left that I can do for you.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-27-38" id="en-CEV-675"><sup class="versenum">38 </sup> “Father,” Esau asked, “don't you have more than one blessing? You can surely give me a blessing too!” Then Esau started crying again.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-27-39" id="en-CEV-676"><sup class="versenum">39 </sup> So his father said:</span></p><div class="poetry"><p class="line"><span class="text Gen-27-39">“Your home will be far</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Gen-27-39">from that fertile land,</span></span><br/><span class="text Gen-27-39">where dew comes down</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Gen-27-39">from the heavens.</span></span><br/><span class="text Gen-27-40" id="en-CEV-677"><sup class="versenum">40 </sup> You will live by the power</span><br/><span class="text Gen-27-40">of your sword</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Gen-27-40">and be your brother's slave.</span></span><br/><span class="text Gen-27-40">But when you decide to be free,</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Gen-27-40">you will break loose.”</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1"><span class="text Gen-27-41" id="en-CEV-678"><sup class="versenum">41 </sup>Esau hated his brother Jacob because he had stolen the blessing that was supposed to be his.
