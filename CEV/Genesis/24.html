<h3><span class="text Gen-24-1" id="en-CEV-511">A Wife for Isaac</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Gen-24-1"><span class="chapternum">24 </span>Abraham was now a very old man. The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had made him rich, and he was successful in everything he did. </span> <span class="text Gen-24-2" id="en-CEV-512"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>One day, Abraham called in his most trusted servant and said to him, “Solemnly promise me </span> <span class="text Gen-24-3" id="en-CEV-513"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>in the name of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, who rules heaven and earth, that you won't choose a wife for my son Isaac from the people here in the land of Canaan. </span> <span class="text Gen-24-4" id="en-CEV-514"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Instead, go back to the land where I was born and find a wife for him from among my relatives.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-24-5" id="en-CEV-515"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>But the servant asked, “What if the young woman I choose refuses to leave home and come here with me? Should I send Isaac there to look for a wife?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-24-6" id="en-CEV-516"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>“No!” Abraham answered. “Don't ever do that, no matter what. </span> <span class="text Gen-24-7" id="en-CEV-517"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> who rules heaven brought me here from the land where I was born and promised that he would give this land to my descendants forever. When you go back there, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will send his angel ahead of you to help you find a wife for my son. </span> <span class="text Gen-24-8" id="en-CEV-518"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>If the woman refuses to come along, you don't have to keep this promise. But don't ever take my son back there.” </span> <span class="text Gen-24-9" id="en-CEV-519"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>So the servant gave Abraham his word that he would do everything he had been told to do.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-24-10" id="en-CEV-520"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Soon after that, the servant loaded ten of Abraham's camels with valuable gifts. Then he set out for the city in northern Syria,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-520a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-520a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-520a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> where Abraham's brother Nahor lived.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-24-11" id="en-CEV-521"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>When he got there, he let the camels rest near the well outside the city. It was late afternoon, the time when the women came out for water. </span> <span class="text Gen-24-12" id="en-CEV-522"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>The servant prayed:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-24-12">You, <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, are the God my master Abraham worships. Please keep your promise to him and let me find a wife for Isaac today. </span> <span class="text Gen-24-13" id="en-CEV-523"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>The young women of the city will soon come to this well for water, </span> <span class="text Gen-24-14" id="en-CEV-524"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>and I'll ask one of them for a drink. If she gives me a drink and then offers to get some water for my camels, I'll know she is the one you have chosen and that you have kept your promise to my master.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-24-15-Gen-24-16" id="en-CEV-525"><sup class="versenum">15-16 </sup>While he was still praying, a beautiful unmarried young woman came by with a water jar on her shoulder. She was Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Abraham's brother Nahor and his wife Milcah. Rebekah walked past Abraham's servant, then went over to the well, and filled her water jar. When she started back, </span> <span class="text Gen-24-17" id="en-CEV-526"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Abraham's servant ran to her and said, “Please let me have a drink of water.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-24-18" id="en-CEV-527"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>“I'll be glad to,” she answered. Then she quickly took the jar from her shoulder and held it while he drank. </span> <span class="text Gen-24-19-Gen-24-20" id="en-CEV-528"><sup class="versenum">19-20 </sup>After he had finished, she said, “Now I'll give your camels all the water they want.” She quickly poured out water for them, and she kept going back for more, until his camels had drunk all they wanted. </span> <span class="text Gen-24-21" id="en-CEV-529"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Abraham's servant did not say a word, but he watched everything Rebekah did, because he wanted to know for certain if this was the woman the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had chosen.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-24-22" id="en-CEV-530"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>The servant had brought along an expensive gold ring and two large gold bracelets. When Rebekah had finished bringing the water, he gave her the ring for her nose<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-530b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-530b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-530b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> and the bracelets for her arms. </span> <span class="text Gen-24-23" id="en-CEV-531"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>Then he said, “Please tell me who your father is. Does he have room in his house for me and my men to spend the night?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-24-24" id="en-CEV-532"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>She answered, “My father is Bethuel, the son of Nahor and Milcah. </span> <span class="text Gen-24-25" id="en-CEV-533"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>We have a place where you and your men can stay, and we also have enough straw and feed for your camels.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-24-26" id="en-CEV-534"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>Then the servant bowed his head and prayed, </span> <span class="text Gen-24-27" id="en-CEV-535"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>“I thank you, <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God of my master Abraham! You have led me to his relatives and kept your promise to him.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-24-28" id="en-CEV-536"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>Rebekah ran straight home and told her family everything. </span> <span class="text Gen-24-29-Gen-24-30" id="en-CEV-537"><sup class="versenum">29-30 </sup>Her brother Laban heard her tell what the servant had said, and he saw the ring and the bracelets she was wearing. So Laban ran out to Abraham's servant, who was standing by his camels at the well. </span> <span class="text Gen-24-31" id="en-CEV-538"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>Then Laban said, “The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has brought you safely here. Come home with me. There's no need for you to keep on standing outside. I have a room ready for you in our house, and there's also a place for your camels.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-24-32" id="en-CEV-539"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>Abraham's servant went home with Laban, where Laban's servants unloaded his camels and gave them straw and feed. Then they brought water into the house, so Abraham's servant and his men could wash their feet. </span> <span class="text Gen-24-33" id="en-CEV-540"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>After that, they brought in food. But the servant said, “Before I eat, I must tell you why I have come.”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-24-33">“Go ahead and tell us,” Laban answered.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-24-34" id="en-CEV-541"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>The servant explained:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-24-34">I am Abraham's servant. </span> <span class="text Gen-24-35" id="en-CEV-542"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has been good to my master and has made him very rich. He has given him many sheep, goats, cattle, camels, and donkeys, as well as a lot of silver and gold, and many slaves. </span> <span class="text Gen-24-36" id="en-CEV-543"><sup class="versenum">36 </sup>Sarah, my master's wife, didn't have any children until she was very old. Then she had a son, and my master has given him everything. </span> <span class="text Gen-24-37" id="en-CEV-544"><sup class="versenum">37 </sup>I solemnly promised my master that I would do what he said. And he told me, “Don't choose a wife for my son from the women in this land of Canaan. </span> <span class="text Gen-24-38" id="en-CEV-545"><sup class="versenum">38 </sup>Instead, go back to the land where I was born and find a wife for my son from among my relatives.”</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-24-39" id="en-CEV-546"><sup class="versenum">39 </sup>I asked my master, “What if the young woman refuses to come with me?”</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-24-40" id="en-CEV-547"><sup class="versenum">40 </sup>My master answered, “I have always obeyed the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, and he will send his angel to help you find my son a wife from among my own relatives. </span> <span class="text Gen-24-41" id="en-CEV-548"><sup class="versenum">41 </sup>But if they refuse to let her come back with you, then you are freed from your promise.”</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-24-42" id="en-CEV-549"><sup class="versenum">42 </sup>When I came to the well today, I silently prayed, “You, <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, are the God my master Abraham worships, so please lead me to a wife for his son </span> <span class="text Gen-24-43" id="en-CEV-550"><sup class="versenum">43 </sup>while I am here at the well. When a young woman comes out to get water, I'll ask her to give me a drink. </span> <span class="text Gen-24-44" id="en-CEV-551"><sup class="versenum">44 </sup>If she gives me a drink and offers to get some water for my camels, I'll know she is the one you have chosen.”</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-24-45" id="en-CEV-552"><sup class="versenum">45 </sup>Even before I had finished praying, Rebekah came by with a water jar on her shoulder. When she had filled the jar, I asked her for a drink. </span> <span class="text Gen-24-46" id="en-CEV-553"><sup class="versenum">46 </sup>She quickly lowered the jar from her shoulder and said, “Have a drink. Then I'll get water for your camels.” So I drank, and after that she got some water for my camels. </span> <span class="text Gen-24-47" id="en-CEV-554"><sup class="versenum">47 </sup>I asked her who her father was, and she answered, “My father is Bethuel the son of Nahor and Milcah.” At once I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms. </span> <span class="text Gen-24-48" id="en-CEV-555"><sup class="versenum">48 </sup>Then I bowed my head and gave thanks to the God my master Abraham worships. The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had led me straight to my master's relatives, and I had found a wife for his son.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-24-49" id="en-CEV-556"><sup class="versenum">49 </sup>Now please tell me if you are willing to do the right thing for my master. Will you treat him fairly, or do I have to look for another young woman?</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-24-50" id="en-CEV-557"><sup class="versenum">50 </sup>Laban and Bethuel answered, “The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has done this. We have no choice in the matter. </span> <span class="text Gen-24-51" id="en-CEV-558"><sup class="versenum">51 </sup>Take Rebekah with you; she can marry your master's son, just as the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has said.” </span> <span class="text Gen-24-52" id="en-CEV-559"><sup class="versenum">52 </sup>Abraham's servant bowed down and thanked the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>. </span> <span class="text Gen-24-53" id="en-CEV-560"><sup class="versenum">53 </sup>Then he gave clothing, as well as silver and gold jewelry, to Rebekah. He also gave expensive gifts to her brother and her mother.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-24-54" id="en-CEV-561"><sup class="versenum">54 </sup>Abraham's servant and the men with him ate and drank, then spent the night there. The next morning they got up, and the servant told Rebekah's mother and brother, “I would like to go back to my master now.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-24-55" id="en-CEV-562"><sup class="versenum">55 </sup>“Let Rebekah stay with us for a week or ten days,” they answered. “Then she may go.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-24-56" id="en-CEV-563"><sup class="versenum">56 </sup>But he said, “Don't make me stay any longer. The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has already helped me find a wife for my master's son. Now let us return.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-24-57" id="en-CEV-564"><sup class="versenum">57 </sup>They answered, “Let's ask Rebekah what she wants to do.” </span> <span class="text Gen-24-58" id="en-CEV-565"><sup class="versenum">58 </sup>They called her and asked, “Are you willing to leave with this man at once?”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-24-58">“Yes,” she answered.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-24-59" id="en-CEV-566"><sup class="versenum">59 </sup>So they agreed to let Rebekah and an old family servant woman<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-566c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-566c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-566c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> leave immediately with Abraham's servant and his men. </span> <span class="text Gen-24-60" id="en-CEV-567"><sup class="versenum">60 </sup>They gave Rebekah their blessing and said, “We pray that God will give you many children and grandchildren and that he will help them defeat their enemies.” </span> <span class="text Gen-24-61" id="en-CEV-568"><sup class="versenum">61 </sup>Afterwards, Rebekah and the young women who were to travel with her prepared to leave.
