After Abraham had mourned for her, </span> <span class="text Gen-23-3" id="en-CEV-497"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>he went to the Hittites and said, </span> <span class="text Gen-23-4" id="en-CEV-498"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup> “I live as a foreigner in your land, and I don't own any property where I can bury my wife. Please let me buy a piece of land.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-23-5-Gen-23-6" id="en-CEV-499"><sup class="versenum">5-6 </sup>“Sir,” they answered, “you are an important man.
