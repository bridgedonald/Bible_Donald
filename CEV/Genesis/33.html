Then the two brothers started crying.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-33-5" id="en-CEV-867"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>When Esau noticed the women and children he asked, “Whose children are these?”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-33-5">Jacob answered, “These are the children the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has been kind enough to give to me, your servant.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-33-6" id="en-CEV-868"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Then the two servant women and their children came and bowed down to Esau. </span> <span class="text Gen-33-7" id="en-CEV-869"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Next, Leah and her children came and bowed down; finally, Joseph and Rachel also came and bowed down.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-33-8" id="en-CEV-870"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Esau asked Jacob, “Why did you send those herds I met along the road?”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-33-8">“Master,” Jacob answered, “I sent them so you would be friendly to me.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-33-9" id="en-CEV-871"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>“But, brother, I already have plenty,” Esau replied. “Keep them for yourself.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-33-10" id="en-CEV-872"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>“No!” Jacob said. “Please accept them as a sign of your friendship for me. When you welcomed me and I saw your face, it was like seeing the face of God. </span> <span class="text Gen-33-11" id="en-CEV-873"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Please accept these as gifts I brought to you. God has been good to me, and I have everything I need.” Jacob kept insisting until Esau agreed.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-33-12" id="en-CEV-874"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>“Let's get ready to travel,” Esau said. “I'll go along with you.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-33-13" id="en-CEV-875"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>But Jacob answered, “Master, you know traveling is hard on children, and I have to look after the sheep and goats that are nursing their young. If my animals travel too much in one day, they will all die. </span> <span class="text Gen-33-14" id="en-CEV-876"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Why don't you go on ahead and let me travel along slowly with the children, the herds, and the flocks. We can meet again in the country of Edom.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-33-15" id="en-CEV-877"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Esau replied, “Let me leave some of my men with you.”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-33-15">“You don't have to do that,” Jacob answered. “I am happy, simply knowing that you are friendly to me.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-33-16" id="en-CEV-878"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>So Esau left for Edom. </span> <span class="text Gen-33-17" id="en-CEV-879"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>But Jacob went to Succoth,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-879a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-879a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-879a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> where he built a house for himself and set up shelters for his animals.
