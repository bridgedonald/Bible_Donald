<h3><span class="text Gen-29-1" id="en-CEV-706">Jacob Arrives at Laban's Home</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Gen-29-1"><span class="chapternum">29 </span>As Jacob continued on his way to the east, </span> <span class="text Gen-29-2" id="en-CEV-707"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>he looked out in a field and saw a well where shepherds took their sheep for water. Three flocks of sheep were lying around the well, which was covered with a large rock. </span> <span class="text Gen-29-3" id="en-CEV-708"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Shepherds would roll the rock away when all their sheep had gathered there. Then after the sheep had been watered, the shepherds would roll the rock back over the mouth of the well.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-29-4" id="en-CEV-709"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Jacob asked the shepherds, “Where are you from?”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-29-4">“We're from Haran,” they answered.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-29-5" id="en-CEV-710"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Then he asked, “Do you know Nahor's grandson Laban?”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-29-5">“Yes we do,” they replied.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-29-6" id="en-CEV-711"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>“How is he?” Jacob asked.</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-29-6">“He's fine,” they answered. “And here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-29-7" id="en-CEV-712"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Jacob told them, “Look, the sun is still high up in the sky, and it's too early to bring in the rest of the flocks. Water your sheep and take them back to the pasture.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-29-8" id="en-CEV-713"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>But they replied, “We can't do that until they all get here, and the rock has been rolled away from the well.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-29-9" id="en-CEV-714"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>While Jacob was still talking with the men, his cousin Rachel came up with her father's sheep. </span> <span class="text Gen-29-10" id="en-CEV-715"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>When Jacob saw her and his uncle's sheep, he rolled the rock away and watered the sheep. </span> <span class="text Gen-29-11" id="en-CEV-716"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>He then kissed Rachel and started crying because he was so happy. </span> <span class="text Gen-29-12" id="en-CEV-717"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>He told her that he was the son of her aunt Rebekah, and she ran and told her father about him.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-29-13" id="en-CEV-718"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>As soon as Laban heard the news, he ran out to meet Jacob. He hugged and kissed him and brought him to his home, where Jacob told him everything that had happened. </span> <span class="text Gen-29-14" id="en-CEV-719"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Laban said, “You are my nephew, and you are like one of my own family.”</span></p><h3><span class="text Gen-29-14">Jacob Marries Leah and Rachel</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-29-14">After Jacob had been there for a month, </span> <span class="text Gen-29-15" id="en-CEV-720"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Laban said to him, “You shouldn't have to work without pay, just because you are a relative of mine. What do you want me to give you?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-29-16-Gen-29-17" id="en-CEV-721"><sup class="versenum">16-17 </sup>Laban had two daughters. Leah was older than Rachel, but her eyes didn't sparkle,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-721a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-721a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-721a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> while Rachel was beautiful and had a good figure. </span> <span class="text Gen-29-18" id="en-CEV-722"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Since Jacob was in love with Rachel, he answered, “If you will let me marry Rachel, I'll work seven years for you.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-29-19" id="en-CEV-723"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Laban replied, “It's better for me to let you marry Rachel than for someone else to have her. So stay and work for me.” </span> <span class="text Gen-29-20" id="en-CEV-724"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Jacob worked seven years for Laban, but the time seemed like only a few days, because he loved Rachel so much.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-29-21" id="en-CEV-725"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Jacob said to Laban, “The time is up, and I want to marry Rachel now!” </span> <span class="text Gen-29-22" id="en-CEV-726"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>So Laban gave a big feast and invited all their neighbors. </span> <span class="text Gen-29-23" id="en-CEV-727"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>But that evening he brought Leah to Jacob, who married her and spent the night with her. </span> <span class="text Gen-29-24" id="en-CEV-728"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>Laban also gave Zilpah to Leah as her servant woman.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-29-25" id="en-CEV-729"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>The next morning Jacob found out that he had married Leah, and he asked Laban, “Why did you do this to me? Didn't I work to get Rachel? Why did you trick me?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-29-26" id="en-CEV-730"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>Laban replied, “In our country the older daughter must get married first. </span> <span class="text Gen-29-27" id="en-CEV-731"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>After you spend this week<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-731b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-731b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-731b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> with Leah, you may also marry Rachel. But you will have to work for me another seven years.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-29-28-Gen-29-30" id="en-CEV-732"><sup class="versenum">28-30 </sup>At the end of the week of celebration, Laban let Jacob marry Rachel, and he gave her his servant woman Bilhah. Jacob loved Rachel more than he did Leah, but he had to work another seven years for Laban.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-29-31" id="en-CEV-733"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> knew that Jacob loved Rachel more than he did Leah, and so he gave children to Leah, but not to Rachel. </span> <span class="text Gen-29-32" id="en-CEV-734"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>Leah gave birth to a son and named him Reuben.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-734c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-734c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-734c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> Then she said, “The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has taken away my sorrow.
