<h3><span class="text Gen-18-1" id="en-CEV-359">The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> Promises Abraham a Son</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Gen-18-1"><span class="chapternum">18 </span>One hot summer afternoon while Abraham was sitting by the entrance to his tent near the sacred trees of Mamre, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> appeared to him. </span> <span class="text Gen-18-2" id="en-CEV-360"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup> Abraham looked up and saw three men standing nearby. He quickly ran to meet them, bowed with his face to the ground, </span> <span class="text Gen-18-3" id="en-CEV-361"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>and said, “Please come to my home where I can serve you. </span> <span class="text Gen-18-4" id="en-CEV-362"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>I'll have some water brought, so you can wash your feet, then you can rest under a tree. </span> <span class="text Gen-18-5" id="en-CEV-363"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Let me get you some food to give you strength before you leave. I would be honored to serve you.”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-18-5">“Thank you very much,” they answered. “We accept your offer.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-18-6" id="en-CEV-364"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Abraham went quickly to his tent and said to Sarah, “Hurry! Get a large sack of flour and make some bread.” </span> <span class="text Gen-18-7" id="en-CEV-365"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>After saying this, he rushed off to his herd of cattle and picked out one of the best calves, which his servant quickly prepared. </span> <span class="text Gen-18-8" id="en-CEV-366"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>He then served his guests some yogurt and milk together with the meat.</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-18-8">While they were eating, he stood near them under the tree, </span> <span class="text Gen-18-9" id="en-CEV-367"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>and they asked, “Where's your wife Sarah?”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-18-9">“She is right there in the tent,” Abraham answered.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-18-10" id="en-CEV-368"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup> One of the guests was the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, and he said, “I'll come back about this time next year, and when I do, Sarah will already have a son.”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-18-10">Sarah was behind Abraham, listening at the entrance to the tent. </span> <span class="text Gen-18-11" id="en-CEV-369"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Abraham and Sarah were very old, and Sarah was well past the age for having children. </span> <span class="text Gen-18-12" id="en-CEV-370"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup> So she laughed and said to herself, “Now that I am worn out and my husband is old, will I really know such happiness?”<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-370a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-370a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-370a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-18-13" id="en-CEV-371"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> asked Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh? Does she doubt that she can have a child in her old age? </span> <span class="text Gen-18-14" id="en-CEV-372"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup> I am the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>! There is nothing too difficult for me. I'll come back next year at the time I promised, and Sarah will already have a son.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-18-15" id="en-CEV-373"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Sarah was so frightened that she lied and said, “I didn't laugh.”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-18-15">“Yes, you did!” he answered.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Gen-18-16" id="en-CEV-374">Abraham Prays for Sodom</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-18-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>When the three men got ready to leave, they looked down toward Sodom, and Abraham walked part of the way with them.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-18-17" id="en-CEV-375"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to himself, “I should tell Abraham what I am going to do, </span> <span class="text Gen-18-18" id="en-CEV-376"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>since his family will become a great and powerful nation that will be a blessing to all the other nations on earth.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-376b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-376b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-376b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Gen-18-19" id="en-CEV-377"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>I have chosen him to teach his family to obey me forever and to do what is right and fair. If they do, I will give Abraham many descendants, just as I promised.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-18-20" id="en-CEV-378"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said, “Abraham, I have heard that the people of Sodom and Gomorrah are doing all kinds of evil things. </span> <span class="text Gen-18-21" id="en-CEV-379"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Now I am going down to see for myself if those people really are that bad. If they aren't, I would like to know.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-18-22" id="en-CEV-380"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>The men turned and started toward Sodom. But the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> stayed with Abraham. </span> <span class="text Gen-18-23" id="en-CEV-381"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>And Abraham asked him, “<span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, when you destroy the evil people, are you also going to destroy those who are good? </span> <span class="text Gen-18-24" id="en-CEV-382"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>Wouldn't you spare the city if there are only 50 good people in it? </span> <span class="text Gen-18-25" id="en-CEV-383"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>You surely wouldn't let them be killed when you destroy the evil ones. You are the judge of all the earth, and you do what is right.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-18-26" id="en-CEV-384"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> replied, “If I find 50 good people in Sodom, I will save the city to keep them from being killed.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-18-27" id="en-CEV-385"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>Abraham answered, “I am nothing more than the dust of the earth. Please forgive me, <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, for daring to speak to you like this. </span> <span class="text Gen-18-28" id="en-CEV-386"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>But suppose there are only 45 good people in Sodom. Would you still wipe out the whole city?”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-18-28">“If I find 45 good people,” the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> replied, “I won't destroy the city.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-18-29" id="en-CEV-387"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>“Suppose there are just 40 good people?” Abraham asked.</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-18-29">“Even for them,” the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> replied, “I won't destroy the city.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-18-30" id="en-CEV-388"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>Abraham said, “Please don't be angry, <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, if I ask you what you will do if there are only 30 good people in the city.”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-18-30">“If I find 30,” the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> replied, “I still won't destroy it.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-18-31" id="en-CEV-389"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>Then Abraham said, “I don't have any right to ask you, <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, but what would you do if you find only 20?”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-18-31">“Because of them, I won't destroy the city,” was the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s answer.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-18-32" id="en-CEV-390"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>Finally, Abraham said, “Please don't get angry, <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, if I speak just once more. Suppose you find only 10 good people there.”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-18-32">“For the sake of 10 good people,” the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> told him, “I still won't destroy the city.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-18-33" id="en-CEV-391"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>After speaking with Abraham, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> left, and Abraham went back home.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
