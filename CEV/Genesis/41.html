<h3><span class="text Gen-41-1" id="en-CEV-1074">Joseph Interprets the King's Dreams</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Gen-41-1"><span class="chapternum">41 </span>Two years later the king<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-1074a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-1074a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-1074a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> of Egypt dreamed he was standing beside the Nile River. </span> <span class="text Gen-41-2" id="en-CEV-1075"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Suddenly, seven fat, healthy cows came up from the river and started eating grass along the bank. </span> <span class="text Gen-41-3" id="en-CEV-1076"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Then seven ugly, skinny cows came up out of the river and </span> <span class="text Gen-41-4" id="en-CEV-1077"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>ate the fat, healthy cows. When this happened, the king woke up.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-41-5" id="en-CEV-1078"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>The king went back to sleep and had another dream. This time seven full heads of grain were growing on a single stalk. </span> <span class="text Gen-41-6" id="en-CEV-1079"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Later, seven other heads of grain appeared, but they were thin and scorched by a wind from the desert. </span> <span class="text Gen-41-7" id="en-CEV-1080"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>The thin heads of grain swallowed the seven full heads. Again the king woke up, and it had only been a dream.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-41-8" id="en-CEV-1081"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup> The next morning the king was upset. So he called in his magicians and wise men and told them what he had dreamed. None of them could tell him what the dreams meant.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-41-9" id="en-CEV-1082"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>The king's personal servant said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-41-9">Now I remember what I was supposed to do. </span> <span class="text Gen-41-10" id="en-CEV-1083"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>When you were angry with me and your chief cook, you threw us both in jail in the house of the captain of the guard. </span> <span class="text Gen-41-11" id="en-CEV-1084"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>One night we both had dreams, and each dream had a different meaning. </span> <span class="text Gen-41-12" id="en-CEV-1085"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>A young Hebrew, who was a servant of the captain of the guard, was there with us at the time. When we told him our dreams, he explained what each of them meant, </span> <span class="text Gen-41-13" id="en-CEV-1086"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>and everything happened just as he said it would. I got my job back, and the cook was put to death.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-41-14" id="en-CEV-1087"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>The king sent for Joseph, who was quickly brought out of jail. He shaved, changed his clothes, and went to the king.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-41-15" id="en-CEV-1088"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>The king said to him, “I had a dream, yet no one can explain what it means. I am told that you can interpret dreams.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-41-16" id="en-CEV-1089"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>“Your Majesty,” Joseph answered, “I can't do it myself, but God can give a good meaning to your dreams.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-41-17" id="en-CEV-1090"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>The king told Joseph:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-41-17">I dreamed I was standing on the bank of the Nile River. </span> <span class="text Gen-41-18" id="en-CEV-1091"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>I saw seven fat, healthy cows come up out of the river, and they began feeding on the grass. </span> <span class="text Gen-41-19" id="en-CEV-1092"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Next, seven skinny, bony cows came up out of the river. I have never seen such terrible looking cows anywhere in Egypt. </span> <span class="text Gen-41-20" id="en-CEV-1093"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>The skinny cows ate the fat ones. </span> <span class="text Gen-41-21" id="en-CEV-1094"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>But you couldn't tell it, because these skinny cows were just as skinny as they were before. At once, I woke up.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-41-22" id="en-CEV-1095"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>I also dreamed that I saw seven heads of grain growing on one stalk. The heads were full and ripe. </span> <span class="text Gen-41-23" id="en-CEV-1096"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>Then seven other heads of grain came up. They were thin and scorched by a wind from the desert. </span> <span class="text Gen-41-24" id="en-CEV-1097"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>These heads of grain swallowed the full ones. I told my dreams to the magicians, but none of them could tell me the meaning of the dreams.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-41-25" id="en-CEV-1098"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Joseph replied:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-41-25">Your Majesty, both of your dreams mean the same thing, and in them God has shown what he is going to do. </span> <span class="text Gen-41-26" id="en-CEV-1099"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>The seven good cows stand for seven years, and so do the seven good heads of grain. </span> <span class="text Gen-41-27" id="en-CEV-1100"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>The seven skinny, ugly cows that came up later also stand for seven years, as do the seven bad heads of grain that were scorched by the desert wind. The dreams mean there will be seven years when there won't be enough grain.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-41-28" id="en-CEV-1101"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>It is just as I said—God has shown what he intends to do. </span> <span class="text Gen-41-29" id="en-CEV-1102"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>For seven years Egypt will have more than enough grain, </span> <span class="text Gen-41-30" id="en-CEV-1103"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>but that will be followed by seven years when there won't be enough. The good years of plenty will be forgotten, and everywhere in Egypt people will be starving. </span> <span class="text Gen-41-31" id="en-CEV-1104"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>The famine will be so bad that no one will remember that once there had been plenty. </span> <span class="text Gen-41-32" id="en-CEV-1105"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>God has given you two dreams to let you know that he has definitely decided to do this and that he will do it soon.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-41-33" id="en-CEV-1106"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>Your Majesty, you should find someone who is wise and will know what to do, so that you can put him in charge of all Egypt. </span> <span class="text Gen-41-34" id="en-CEV-1107"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>Then appoint some other officials to collect one fifth of every crop harvested in Egypt during the seven years when there is plenty. </span> <span class="text Gen-41-35" id="en-CEV-1108"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>Give them the power to collect the grain during those good years and to store it in your cities. </span> <span class="text Gen-41-36" id="en-CEV-1109"><sup class="versenum">36 </sup>It can be stored until it is needed during the seven years when there won't be enough grain in Egypt. This will keep the country from being destroyed because of the lack of food.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Gen-41-37" id="en-CEV-1110">Joseph Is Made Governor over Egypt</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-41-37"><sup class="versenum">37 </sup>The king<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-1110b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-1110b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-1110b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> and his officials liked this plan. </span> <span class="text Gen-41-38" id="en-CEV-1111"><sup class="versenum">38 </sup>So the king said to them, “Who could possibly handle this better than Joseph? After all, the Spirit of God is with him.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-41-39" id="en-CEV-1112"><sup class="versenum">39 </sup>The king told Joseph, “God is the one who has shown you these things. No one else is as wise as you are or knows as much as you do. </span> <span class="text Gen-41-40" id="en-CEV-1113"><sup class="versenum">40 </sup> I'm putting you in charge of my palace, and everybody will have to obey you. No one will be over you except me. </span> <span class="text Gen-41-41" id="en-CEV-1114"><sup class="versenum">41 </sup>You are now governor of all Egypt!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-41-42" id="en-CEV-1115"><sup class="versenum">42 </sup> Then the king took off his royal ring and put it on Joseph's finger. He gave him fine clothes to wear and placed a gold chain around his neck. </span> <span class="text Gen-41-43" id="en-CEV-1116"><sup class="versenum">43 </sup>He also let him ride in the chariot next to his own, and people shouted, “Make way for Joseph!” So Joseph was governor of Egypt.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-41-44" id="en-CEV-1117"><sup class="versenum">44 </sup>The king told Joseph, “Although I'm king, no one in Egypt is to do anything without your permission.” </span> <span class="text Gen-41-45" id="en-CEV-1118"><sup class="versenum">45 </sup>He gave Joseph the Egyptian name Zaphenath Paneah. And he let him marry Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, a priest in the city of Heliopolis.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-1118c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-1118c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-1118c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> Joseph traveled all over<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-1118d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-1118d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-1118d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> Egypt.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-41-46" id="en-CEV-1119"><sup class="versenum">46 </sup>Joseph was 30 when the king made him governor, and he went everywhere for the king. </span> <span class="text Gen-41-47" id="en-CEV-1120"><sup class="versenum">47 </sup>For seven years there were big harvests of grain. </span> <span class="text Gen-41-48" id="en-CEV-1121"><sup class="versenum">48 </sup>Joseph collected and stored up the extra grain in the cities of Egypt near the fields where it was harvested. </span> <span class="text Gen-41-49" id="en-CEV-1122"><sup class="versenum">49 </sup>In fact, there was so much grain that they stopped keeping record, because it was like counting the grains of sand along the beach.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-41-50" id="en-CEV-1123"><sup class="versenum">50 </sup>Joseph and his wife had two sons before the famine began. </span> <span class="text Gen-41-51" id="en-CEV-1124"><sup class="versenum">51 </sup>Their first son was named Manasseh, which means, “God has let me forget all my troubles and my family back home.” </span> <span class="text Gen-41-52" id="en-CEV-1125"><sup class="versenum">52 </sup>His second son was named Ephraim, which means “God has made me a success<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-1125e" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-1125e" title="See footnote e"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-1125e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> in the land where I suffered.”<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-1125f" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-1125f" title="See footnote f"&gt;f&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-1125f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-41-53" id="en-CEV-1126"><sup class="versenum">53 </sup>Egypt's seven years of plenty came to an end, </span> <span class="text Gen-41-54" id="en-CEV-1127"><sup class="versenum">54 </sup> and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said.
