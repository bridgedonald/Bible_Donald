<h3><span class="text Gen-34-1" id="en-CEV-883">Dinah Is Raped</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Gen-34-1"><span class="chapternum">34 </span>Dinah, the daughter of Jacob and Leah, went to visit some of the women who lived nearby. </span> <span class="text Gen-34-2" id="en-CEV-884"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>She was seen by Hamor's son Shechem, the leader of the Hivites, and he grabbed her and raped her. </span> <span class="text Gen-34-3" id="en-CEV-885"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>But Shechem was attracted to Dinah, so he told her how much he loved her. </span> <span class="text Gen-34-4" id="en-CEV-886"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Shechem even asked his father to arrange for him to marry her.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-34-5" id="en-CEV-887"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Meanwhile, Jacob heard what had happened. But his sons were out in the fields with the cattle, so he did not do anything at the time. </span> <span class="text Gen-34-6" id="en-CEV-888"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Hamor arrived at Jacob's home </span> <span class="text Gen-34-7" id="en-CEV-889"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>just as Jacob's sons were coming in from work. When they learned that their sister had been raped, they became furiously angry, because nothing is more disgraceful than rape, and it must not be tolerated.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-34-8" id="en-CEV-890"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Hamor said to Jacob and his sons:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-34-8">My son Shechem really loves Dinah. Please let him marry her. </span> <span class="text Gen-34-9" id="en-CEV-891"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Why don't you start letting your families marry into our families and ours marry into yours? </span> <span class="text Gen-34-10" id="en-CEV-892"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>You can share this land with us. Move freely about until you find the property you want; then buy it and settle down here.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-34-11" id="en-CEV-893"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Shechem added, “Do this favor for me, and I'll give whatever you want. </span> <span class="text Gen-34-12" id="en-CEV-894"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Ask anything, no matter how expensive. I'll do anything, just let me marry Dinah.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-34-13" id="en-CEV-895"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Jacob's sons wanted to get even with Shechem and his father because of what had happened to their sister. </span> <span class="text Gen-34-14" id="en-CEV-896"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>So they tricked them by saying:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-34-14">You're not circumcised!<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-896a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-896a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-896a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> It would be a disgrace for us to let you marry Dinah now. </span> <span class="text Gen-34-15" id="en-CEV-897"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>But we will let you marry her, if you and the other men in your tribe agree to be circumcised. </span> <span class="text Gen-34-16" id="en-CEV-898"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Then your families can marry into ours, and ours can marry into yours, and we can live together like one nation. </span> <span class="text Gen-34-17" id="en-CEV-899"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>But if you don't agree to be circumcised, we'll take Dinah and leave this place.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-34-18" id="en-CEV-900"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Hamor and Shechem liked what was said. </span> <span class="text Gen-34-19" id="en-CEV-901"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Shechem was the most respected person in his family, and he was so in love with Dinah that he hurried off to get everything done. </span> <span class="text Gen-34-20" id="en-CEV-902"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>The two men met with the other leaders of their city and told them:</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-34-21" id="en-CEV-903"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>These people really are friendly. Why not let them move freely about until they find the property they want? There's enough land here for them and for us. Then our families can marry into theirs, and theirs can marry into ours.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Gen-34-22" id="en-CEV-904"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>We have to do only one thing before they will agree to stay here and become one nation with us. Our men will have to be circumcised just like theirs. </span> <span class="text Gen-34-23" id="en-CEV-905"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>Just think! We'll get their property, as well as their flocks and herds. All we have to do is to agree, and they will live here with us.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-34-24" id="en-CEV-906"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>Every grown man followed this advice and got circumcised.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Gen-34-25" id="en-CEV-907">Dinah's Brothers Take Revenge</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-34-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Three days later the men who had been circumcised were still weak from pain. So Simeon and Levi,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-907b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-907b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-907b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> two of Dinah's brothers, attacked with their swords and killed every man in the town, </span> <span class="text Gen-34-26" id="en-CEV-908"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>including Hamor and Shechem. Then they took Dinah and left. </span> <span class="text Gen-34-27" id="en-CEV-909"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>Jacob's other sons came and took everything they wanted. All this was done because of the horrible thing that had happened to their sister. </span> <span class="text Gen-34-28" id="en-CEV-910"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>They took sheep, goats, donkeys, and everything else that was in the town or the countryside. </span> <span class="text Gen-34-29" id="en-CEV-911"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>After taking everything of value from the houses, they dragged away the wives and children of their victims.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-34-30" id="en-CEV-912"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “Look what you've done! Now I'm in real trouble with the Canaanites and Perizzites who live around here. There aren't many of us, and if they attack, they'll kill everyone in my household.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-34-31" id="en-CEV-913"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>They answered, “Was it right to let our own sister be treated that way?”</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
