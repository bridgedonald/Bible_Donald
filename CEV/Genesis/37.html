Jacob had even given Joseph a fancy coat<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-968b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-968b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-968b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Gen-37-4" id="en-CEV-969"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>which showed that Joseph was his favorite son, and so Joseph's brothers hated him and would not be friendly to him.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-37-5" id="en-CEV-970"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>One day, Joseph told his brothers what he had dreamed, and they hated him even more. </span> <span class="text Gen-37-6" id="en-CEV-971"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Joseph said, “Let me tell you about my dream. </span> <span class="text Gen-37-7" id="en-CEV-972"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>We were out in the field, tying up bundles of wheat. Suddenly my bundle stood up, and your bundles gathered around and bowed down to it.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-37-8" id="en-CEV-973"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>His brothers asked, “Do you really think you are going to be king and rule over us?” Now they hated Joseph more than ever because of what he had said about his dream.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-37-9" id="en-CEV-974"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Joseph later had another dream, and he told his brothers, “Listen to what else I dreamed. The sun, the moon, and eleven stars bowed down to me.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-37-10" id="en-CEV-975"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>When he told his father about this dream, his father became angry and said, “What's that supposed to mean? Are your mother and I and your brothers all going to come and bow down to you?” </span> <span class="text Gen-37-11" id="en-CEV-976"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup> Joseph's brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept wondering about the dream.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Gen-37-12" id="en-CEV-977">Joseph Is Sold and Taken to Egypt</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-37-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>One day when Joseph's brothers had taken the sheep to a pasture near Shechem, </span> <span class="text Gen-37-13" id="en-CEV-978"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>his father Jacob said to him, “I want you to go to your brothers. They are with the sheep near Shechem.”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-37-13">“Yes, sir,” Joseph answered.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-37-14" id="en-CEV-979"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>His father said, “Go and find out how your brothers and the sheep are doing. Then come back and let me know.” So he sent him from Hebron Valley.</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-37-14">Joseph was near Shechem </span> <span class="text Gen-37-15" id="en-CEV-980"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>and wandering through the fields, when a man asked, “What are you looking for?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-37-16" id="en-CEV-981"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Joseph answered, “I'm looking for my brothers who are watching the sheep. Can you tell me where they are?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-37-17" id="en-CEV-982"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>“They're not here anymore,” the man replied. “I overheard them say they were going to Dothan.”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-37-17">Joseph left and found his brothers in Dothan. </span> <span class="text Gen-37-18" id="en-CEV-983"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>But before he got there, they saw him coming and made plans to kill him. </span> <span class="text Gen-37-19" id="en-CEV-984"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>They said to one another, “Look, here comes the hero of those dreams! </span> <span class="text Gen-37-20" id="en-CEV-985"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Let's kill him and throw him into a pit and say that some wild animal ate him. Then we'll see what happens to those dreams.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-37-21" id="en-CEV-986"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Reuben heard this and tried to protect Joseph from them. “Let's not kill him,” he said. </span> <span class="text Gen-37-22" id="en-CEV-987"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>“Don't murder him or even harm him. Just throw him into a well out here in the desert.” Reuben planned to rescue Joseph later and take him back to his father.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-37-23" id="en-CEV-988"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>When Joseph came to his brothers, they pulled off his fancy coat<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-988c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-988c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-988c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Gen-37-24" id="en-CEV-989"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>and threw him into a dry well.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-37-25" id="en-CEV-990"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>As Joseph's brothers sat down to eat, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were loaded with all kinds of spices that they were taking to Egypt. </span> <span class="text Gen-37-26" id="en-CEV-991"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>So Judah said, “What will we gain if we kill our brother and hide his body? </span> <span class="text Gen-37-27" id="en-CEV-992"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>Let's sell him to the Ishmaelites and not harm him. After all, he is our brother.” And the others agreed.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-37-28" id="en-CEV-993"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup> When the Midianite merchants came by, Joseph's brothers took him out of the well, and for 20 pieces of silver they sold him to the Ishmaelites<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-993d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-993d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-993d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> who took him to Egypt.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-37-29" id="en-CEV-994"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>When Reuben returned to the well and did not find Joseph there, he tore his clothes in sorrow. </span> <span class="text Gen-37-30" id="en-CEV-995"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>Then he went back to his brothers and said, “The boy is gone! What am I going to do?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-37-31" id="en-CEV-996"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>Joseph's brothers killed a goat and dipped Joseph's fancy coat in its blood. </span> <span class="text Gen-37-32" id="en-CEV-997"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>After this, they took the coat to their father and said, “We found this! Look at it carefully and see if it belongs to your son.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-37-33" id="en-CEV-998"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>Jacob knew it was Joseph's coat and said, “It's my son's coat! Joseph has been torn to pieces and eaten by some wild animal.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-37-34" id="en-CEV-999"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>Jacob mourned for Joseph a long time, and to show his sorrow he tore his clothes and wore sackcloth.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-999e" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-999e" title="See footnote e"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-999e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Gen-37-35" id="en-CEV-1000"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>All of Jacob's children came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. “No,” he said, “I will go to my grave, mourning for my son.” So Jacob kept on grieving.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gen-37-36" id="en-CEV-1001"><sup class="versenum">36 </sup>Meanwhile, the Midianites had sold Joseph in Egypt to a man named Potiphar, who was the king's<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-1001f" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-1001f" title="See footnote f"&gt;f&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-1001f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> official in charge of the palace guard.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
