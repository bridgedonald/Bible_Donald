<h3><span class="text Jonah-1-1" id="en-CEV-20534">Jonah Runs from the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Jonah-1-1"><span class="chapternum">1 </span> One day the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> told Jonah, the son of Amittai, </span> <span class="text Jonah-1-2" id="en-CEV-20535"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>to go to the great city of Nineveh<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-20535a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-20535a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-20535a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> and say to the people, “The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has seen your terrible sins. You are doomed!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Jonah-1-3" id="en-CEV-20536"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Instead, Jonah ran from the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>. He went to the seaport of Joppa and found a ship that was going to Spain. So he paid his fare, then got on the ship and sailed away to escape.</span></p> <p><span class="text Jonah-1-4" id="en-CEV-20537"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>But the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> made a strong wind blow, and such a bad storm came up that the ship was about to be broken to pieces. </span> <span class="text Jonah-1-5" id="en-CEV-20538"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>The sailors were frightened, and they all started praying to their gods. They even threw the ship's cargo overboard to make the ship lighter.</span></p><p><span class="text Jonah-1-5">All this time, Jonah was down below deck, sound asleep. </span> <span class="text Jonah-1-6" id="en-CEV-20539"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>The ship's captain went to him and said, “How can you sleep at a time like this? Get up and pray to your God! Maybe he will have pity on us and keep us from drowning.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Jonah-1-7" id="en-CEV-20540"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Finally, the sailors got together and said, “Let's ask our gods to show us<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-20540b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-20540b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-20540b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> who caused all this trouble.” It turned out to be Jonah.</span></p> <p><span class="text Jonah-1-8" id="en-CEV-20541"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>They started asking him, “Are you the one who brought all this trouble on us? What business are you in? Where do you come from? What is your country? Who are your people?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Jonah-1-9" id="en-CEV-20542"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Jonah answered, “I'm a Hebrew, and I worship the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Jonah-1-10" id="en-CEV-20543"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>When the sailors heard this, they were frightened, because Jonah had already told them he was running from the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>. Then they said, “Do you know what you have done?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Jonah-1-11" id="en-CEV-20544"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>The storm kept getting worse, until finally the sailors asked him, “What should we do with you to make the sea calm down?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Jonah-1-12" id="en-CEV-20545"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Jonah told them, “Throw me into the sea, and it will calm down. I'm the cause of this terrible storm.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Jonah-1-13" id="en-CEV-20546"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>The sailors tried their best to row to the shore. But they could not do it, and the storm kept getting worse every minute. </span> <span class="text Jonah-1-14" id="en-CEV-20547"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>So they prayed to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, “Please don't let us drown for taking this man's life. Don't hold us guilty for killing an innocent man. All of this happened because you wanted it to.” </span> <span class="text Jonah-1-15" id="en-CEV-20548"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Then they threw Jonah overboard, and the sea calmed down. </span> <span class="text Jonah-1-16" id="en-CEV-20549"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>The sailors were so terrified that they offered a sacrifice to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> and made all kinds of promises.</span></p> <p><span class="text Jonah-1-17" id="en-CEV-20550"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup> The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> sent a big fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was inside the fish for three days and three nights.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
