<h3><span class="text Jonah-4-1" id="en-CEV-20569">Jonah Gets Angry with the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Jonah-4-1"><span class="chapternum">4 </span>Jonah was really upset and angry. </span> <span class="text Jonah-4-2" id="en-CEV-20570"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup> So he prayed:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Jonah-4-2">Our <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, I knew from the very beginning that you wouldn't destroy Nineveh. That's why I left my own country and headed for Spain. You are a kind and merciful God, and you are very patient. You always show love, and you don't like to punish anyone.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Jonah-4-3" id="en-CEV-20571"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup> Now let me die! I'd be better off dead.</span></p> <p><span class="text Jonah-4-4" id="en-CEV-20572"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> replied, “What right do you have to be angry?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Jonah-4-5" id="en-CEV-20573"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Jonah then left through the east gate of the city and made a shelter to protect himself from the sun. He sat under the shelter, waiting to see what would happen to Nineveh.</span></p> <p><span class="text Jonah-4-6" id="en-CEV-20574"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> made a vine grow up to shade Jonah's head and protect him from the sun. Jonah was very happy to have the vine, </span> <span class="text Jonah-4-7" id="en-CEV-20575"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>but early the next morning the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> sent a worm to chew on the vine, and the vine dried up. </span> <span class="text Jonah-4-8" id="en-CEV-20576"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>During the day the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> sent a scorching wind, and the sun beat down on Jonah's head, making him feel faint. Jonah was ready to die, and he shouted, “I wish I were dead!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Jonah-4-9" id="en-CEV-20577"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>But the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> asked, “Jonah, do you have the right to be angry about the vine?”</span></p><p><span class="text Jonah-4-9">“Yes, I do,” he answered, “and I'm angry enough to die.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Jonah-4-10" id="en-CEV-20578"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>But the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Jonah-4-10">You are concerned about a vine that you did not plant or take care of, a vine that grew up in one night and died the next. </span> <span class="text Jonah-4-11" id="en-CEV-20579"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>In that city of Nineveh there are more than 120,000 people who cannot tell right from wrong, and many cattle are also there. Don't you think I should be concerned about that big city?</span></p>  <!--end of crossrefs-->
