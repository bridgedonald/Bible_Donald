<h3><span class="text Heb-13-1" id="en-CEV-28124">Service That Pleases God</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Heb-13-1"><span class="chapternum">13 </span>Keep being concerned about each other as the Lord's followers should.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-13-2" id="en-CEV-28125"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup> Be sure to welcome strangers into your home. By doing this, some people have welcomed angels as guests, without even knowing it.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-13-3" id="en-CEV-28126"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Remember the Lord's people who are in jail and be concerned for them. Don't forget those who are suffering, but imagine you are there with them.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-13-4" id="en-CEV-28127"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup> Have respect for marriage. Always be faithful to your partner, because God will punish anyone who is immoral or unfaithful in marriage.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-13-5" id="en-CEV-28128"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup> Don't fall in love with money. Be satisfied with what you have. The Lord has promised that he will not leave us or desert us. </span> <span class="text Heb-13-6" id="en-CEV-28129"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup> This should make you feel like saying,</span></p><div class="poetry"><p class="line"><span class="text Heb-13-6">“The Lord helps me!</span><br/><span class="text Heb-13-6">Why should I be afraid</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Heb-13-6">of what people</span></span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Heb-13-6">can do to me?”</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1"><span class="text Heb-13-7" id="en-CEV-28130"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Don't forget about your leaders who taught you God's message. Remember what kind of lives they lived and try to have faith like theirs.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-13-8" id="en-CEV-28131"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Jesus Christ never changes! He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. </span> <span class="text Heb-13-9" id="en-CEV-28132"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Don't be fooled by any kind of strange teachings. It is better to receive strength from God's gift of undeserved grace than to depend on certain foods. After all, these foods don't really help the people who eat them. </span> <span class="text Heb-13-10" id="en-CEV-28133"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>But we have an altar where even the priests who serve in the place of worship have no right to eat.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-13-11" id="en-CEV-28134"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup> After the high priest offers the blood of animals as a sin offering, the bodies of those animals are burned outside the camp. </span> <span class="text Heb-13-12" id="en-CEV-28135"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Jesus himself suffered outside the city gate, so his blood would make people holy. </span> <span class="text Heb-13-13" id="en-CEV-28136"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>This is why we should go outside the camp to Jesus and share in his disgrace. </span> <span class="text Heb-13-14" id="en-CEV-28137"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>On this earth we don't have a city that lasts forever, but we are waiting for such a city.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-13-15" id="en-CEV-28138"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Our sacrifice is to keep offering praise to God in the name of Jesus. </span> <span class="text Heb-13-16" id="en-CEV-28139"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>But don't forget to help others and to share your possessions with them. This too is like offering a sacrifice that pleases God.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-13-17" id="en-CEV-28140"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Obey your leaders and do what they say. They are watching over you, and they must answer to God. So don't make them sad as they do their work. Make them happy. Otherwise, they won't be able to help you at all.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-13-18" id="en-CEV-28141"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Pray for us.
