<h3><span class="text Heb-12-1" id="en-CEV-28095">A Large Crowd of Witnesses</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Heb-12-1"><span class="chapternum">12 </span> Such a large crowd of witnesses is all around us! So we must get rid of everything that slows us down, especially the sin that just won't let go. And we must be determined to run the race that is ahead of us. </span> <span class="text Heb-12-2" id="en-CEV-28096"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup> We must keep our eyes on Jesus, who leads us and makes our faith complete. He endured the shame of being nailed to a cross, because he knew later on he would be glad he did. Now he is seated at the right side<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28096a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28096a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28096a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> of God's throne! </span> <span class="text Heb-12-3" id="en-CEV-28097"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>So keep your mind on Jesus, who put up with many insults from sinners. Then you won't get discouraged and give up.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-12-4" id="en-CEV-28098"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>None of you have yet been hurt<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28098b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28098b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28098b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> in your battle against sin. </span> <span class="text Heb-12-5" id="en-CEV-28099"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup> But you have forgotten that the Scriptures say to God's children,</span></p><div class="poetry"><p class="line"><span class="text Heb-12-5">“When the Lord punishes you,</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Heb-12-5">don't make light of it,</span></span><br/><span class="text Heb-12-5">and when he corrects you,</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Heb-12-5">don't be discouraged.</span></span><br/><span class="text Heb-12-6" id="en-CEV-28100"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>The Lord corrects the people</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Heb-12-6">he loves</span></span><br/><span class="text Heb-12-6">and disciplines those</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Heb-12-6">he calls his own.”</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1"><span class="text Heb-12-7" id="en-CEV-28101"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Be patient when you are being corrected! This is how God treats his children. Don't all parents correct their children? </span> <span class="text Heb-12-8" id="en-CEV-28102"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>God corrects all his children, and if he doesn't correct you, then you don't really belong to him. </span> <span class="text Heb-12-9" id="en-CEV-28103"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Our earthly fathers correct us, and we still respect them. Isn't it even better to be given true life by letting our spiritual Father correct us?</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-12-10" id="en-CEV-28104"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Our human fathers correct us for a short time, and they do it as they think best. But God corrects us for our own good, because he wants us to be holy, as he is. </span> <span class="text Heb-12-11" id="en-CEV-28105"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>It is never fun to be corrected. In fact, at the time it is always painful. But if we learn to obey by being corrected, we will do right and live at peace.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-12-12" id="en-CEV-28106"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup> Now stand up straight! Stop your knees from shaking </span> <span class="text Heb-12-13" id="en-CEV-28107"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup> and walk a straight path. Then lame people will be healed, instead of getting worse.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Heb-12-14" id="en-CEV-28108">Warning against Turning from God</span></h3><p><span class="text Heb-12-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Try to live at peace with everyone! Live a clean life. If you don't, you will never see the Lord. </span> <span class="text Heb-12-15" id="en-CEV-28109"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup> Make sure no one misses out on God's wonderful kindness. Don't let anyone become bitter and cause trouble for the rest of you. </span> <span class="text Heb-12-16" id="en-CEV-28110"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup> Watch out for immoral and ungodly people like Esau, who sold his future blessing<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28110c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28110c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28110c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> for only one meal. </span> <span class="text Heb-12-17" id="en-CEV-28111"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup> You know how he later wanted it back.

But they begged it to stop, </span> <span class="text Heb-12-20" id="en-CEV-28114"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup> because they could not obey its commands. They were even told to kill any animal that touched the mountain. </span> <span class="text Heb-12-21" id="en-CEV-28115"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>The sight was so frightening that Moses said he shook with fear.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-12-22" id="en-CEV-28116"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>You have now come to Mount Zion and to the heavenly Jerusalem.

Here also are the spirits of those good people who have been made perfect. </span> <span class="text Heb-12-24" id="en-CEV-28118"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup> And Jesus is here! He is the one who makes God's new agreement with us, and his sprinkled blood says much better things than the blood of Abel.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28118f" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28118f" title="See footnote f"&gt;f&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28118f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-12-25" id="en-CEV-28119"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup> Make sure you obey the one who speaks to you. The people did not escape, when they refused to obey the one who spoke to them at Mount Sinai. Do you think you can possibly escape, if you refuse to obey the one who speaks to you from heaven? </span> <span class="text Heb-12-26" id="en-CEV-28120"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup> When God spoke the first time, his voice shook only the earth. This time he has promised to shake the earth once again, and heaven too.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-12-27" id="en-CEV-28121"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>The words “once again” mean that these created things will someday be shaken and removed. Then what cannot be shaken will last. </span> <span class="text Heb-12-28" id="en-CEV-28122"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>We should be grateful we were given a kingdom that cannot be shaken. And in this kingdom we please God by worshiping him and by showing him great honor and respect. </span> <span class="text Heb-12-29" id="en-CEV-28123"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup> Our God is like a destructive fire!</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
