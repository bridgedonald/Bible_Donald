<h3><span class="text Heb-7-1" id="en-CEV-27950">The Priestly Family of Melchizedek</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Heb-7-1"><span class="chapternum">7 </span> Melchizedek was both king of Salem and priest of God Most High. He was the one who went out and gave Abraham his blessing, when Abraham returned from killing the kings. </span> <span class="text Heb-7-2" id="en-CEV-27951"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Then Abraham gave him a tenth of everything he had.</span></p><p><span class="text Heb-7-2">The meaning of the name Melchizedek is “King of Justice.” But since Salem means “peace,” he is also “King of Peace.” </span> <span class="text Heb-7-3" id="en-CEV-27952"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>We are not told he had a father or mother or ancestors or beginning or end. He is like the Son of God and will be a priest forever.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27952a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27952a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27952a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-7-4" id="en-CEV-27953"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Notice how great Melchizedek was! Our famous ancestor Abraham gave him a tenth of what he had taken from his enemies. </span> <span class="text Heb-7-5" id="en-CEV-27954"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup> The Law teaches that even Abraham's descendants must give a tenth of what they possess. And they are to give this to their own relatives, who are the descendants of Levi and are priests. </span> <span class="text Heb-7-6" id="en-CEV-27955"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Although Melchizedek wasn't a descendant of Levi, Abraham gave him a tenth of what he had. Then Melchizedek blessed Abraham, who had been given God's promise. </span> <span class="text Heb-7-7" id="en-CEV-27956"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Everyone agrees a person who gives a blessing is greater than the one who receives the blessing.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-7-8" id="en-CEV-27957"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Priests are given a tenth of what people earn. But all priests die, except Melchizedek, and the Scriptures teach that he is alive. </span> <span class="text Heb-7-9" id="en-CEV-27958"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Levi's descendants are now the ones who receive a tenth from people. We could even say that when Abraham gave Melchizedek a tenth, Levi also gave him a tenth. </span> <span class="text Heb-7-10" id="en-CEV-27959"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>This is because Levi was born later into the family of Abraham, who gave a tenth to Melchizedek.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-7-11" id="en-CEV-27960"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Even though the Law of Moses says the priests must be descendants of Levi, those priests cannot make anyone perfect. So there needs to be a priest like Melchizedek, rather than one from the priestly family of Aaron.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27960b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27960b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27960b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Heb-7-12" id="en-CEV-27961"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>And when the rules for selecting a priest are changed, the Law must also be changed.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-7-13" id="en-CEV-27962"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>The person we are talking about is our Lord, who came from a tribe that had never had anyone to serve as a priest at the altar. </span> <span class="text Heb-7-14" id="en-CEV-27963"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Everyone knows he came from the tribe of Judah, and Moses never said priests would come from that tribe.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-7-15" id="en-CEV-27964"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>All of this becomes clearer, when someone who is like Melchizedek is appointed to be a priest. </span> <span class="text Heb-7-16" id="en-CEV-27965"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>That person wasn't appointed because of his ancestors, but because his life can never end. </span> <span class="text Heb-7-17" id="en-CEV-27966"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup> The Scriptures say about him,</span></p><div class="poetry"><p class="line"><span class="text Heb-7-17">“You are a priest forever,</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Heb-7-17">just like Melchizedek.”</span></span></p></div> <top1></top1> <p class="first-line-none"><span class="text Heb-7-18" id="en-CEV-27967"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>In this way a weak and useless command was put aside, </span> <span class="text Heb-7-19" id="en-CEV-27968"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>because the Law cannot make anything perfect. At the same time, we are given a much better hope, and it can bring us close to God.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-7-20-Heb-7-21" id="en-CEV-27969"><sup class="versenum">20-21 </sup> God himself made a promise when this priest was appointed. But he did not make a promise like this when the other priests were appointed. The promise he made is,</span></p><div class="poetry"><p class="line"><span class="text Heb-7-20-Heb-7-21">“I, the Lord, promise that you</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Heb-7-20-Heb-7-21">will be a priest forever!</span></span><br/><span class="text Heb-7-20-Heb-7-21">And I will never</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Heb-7-20-Heb-7-21">change my mind!”</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1"><span class="text Heb-7-22" id="en-CEV-27970"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>This means that Jesus guarantees us a better agreement with God. </span> <span class="text Heb-7-23" id="en-CEV-27971"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>There have been a lot of other priests, and all of them have died. </span> <span class="text Heb-7-24" id="en-CEV-27972"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>But Jesus will never die, and so he will be a priest forever! </span> <span class="text Heb-7-25" id="en-CEV-27973"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>He is forever able to save<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27973c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27973c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27973c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> the people he leads to God, because he always lives to speak to God for them.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-7-26" id="en-CEV-27974"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>Jesus is the high priest we need. He is holy and innocent and faultless, and not at all like us sinners. Jesus is honored above all beings in heaven, </span> <span class="text Heb-7-27" id="en-CEV-27975"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup> and he is better than any other high priest. Jesus doesn't need to offer sacrifices each day for his own sins and then for the sins of the people. He offered a sacrifice once for all, when he gave himself. </span> <span class="text Heb-7-28" id="en-CEV-27976"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>The Law appoints priests who have weaknesses. But God's promise, which came later than the Law, appoints his Son. And he is the perfect high priest forever.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
