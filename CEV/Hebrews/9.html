<h3><span class="text Heb-9-1" id="en-CEV-27990">The Tent in Heaven</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Heb-9-1"><span class="chapternum">9 </span>The first promise included rules for worship and a tent for worship here on earth. </span> <span class="text Heb-9-2" id="en-CEV-27991"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup> The first part of the tent was called the holy place, and a lampstand, a table, and the sacred loaves of bread were kept there.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-9-3" id="en-CEV-27992"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup> Behind the curtain was the most holy place. </span> <span class="text Heb-9-4" id="en-CEV-27993"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup> The gold altar for burning incense was in this holy place. The gold-covered sacred chest was also there, and inside it were three things. First, there was a gold jar filled with manna.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27993a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27993a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27993a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> Then there was Aaron's walking stick that sprouted.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27993b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27993b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27993b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> Finally, there were the flat stones with the Ten Commandments written on them. </span> <span class="text Heb-9-5" id="en-CEV-27994"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup> On top of the chest were the glorious creatures with wings<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27994c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27994c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27994c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> opened out above the place of mercy.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27994d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27994d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27994d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup></span></p><p><span class="text Heb-9-5">Now isn't the time to go into detail about these things. </span> <span class="text Heb-9-6" id="en-CEV-27995"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup> But this is how everything was when the priests went each day into the first part of the tent to do their duties. </span> <span class="text Heb-9-7" id="en-CEV-27996"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup> However, only the high priest could go into the second part of the tent, and he went in only once a year. Each time he carried blood to offer for his sins and for any sins that the people had committed without meaning to.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-9-8" id="en-CEV-27997"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>All of this is the Holy Spirit's way of saying no one could enter the most holy place while the tent was still the place of worship. </span> <span class="text Heb-9-9" id="en-CEV-27998"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>This also has a meaning for today. It shows we cannot make our consciences clear by offering gifts and sacrifices. </span> <span class="text Heb-9-10" id="en-CEV-27999"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>These rules are merely about such things as eating and drinking and ceremonies for washing ourselves. And rules about physical things will last only until the time comes to change them for something better.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-9-11" id="en-CEV-28000"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup> Christ came as the high priest of the good things that are now here.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28000e" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28000e" title="See footnote e"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28000e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> He also went into a much better tent that wasn't made by humans and that doesn't belong to this world. </span> <span class="text Heb-9-12" id="en-CEV-28001"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Then Christ went once for all into the most holy place and freed us from sin forever. He did this by offering his own blood instead of the blood of goats and bulls.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-9-13" id="en-CEV-28002"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup> According to the Law of Moses, those people who become unclean are not fit to worship God. Yet they will be considered clean, if they are sprinkled with the blood of goats and bulls and with the ashes of a sacrificed calf. </span> <span class="text Heb-9-14" id="en-CEV-28003"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>But Christ was sinless, and he offered himself as an eternal and spiritual sacrifice to God. This is why his blood is much more powerful and makes our<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28003f" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28003f" title="See footnote f"&gt;f&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28003f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> consciences clear. Now we can serve the living God and no longer do things that lead to death.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-9-15" id="en-CEV-28004"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Christ died to rescue those who had sinned and broken the old agreement. Now he brings his chosen ones a new agreement with its guarantee of God's eternal blessings! </span> <span class="text Heb-9-16" id="en-CEV-28005"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>In fact, making an agreement of this kind is like writing a will. This is because the one who makes the will must die before it is of any use. </span> <span class="text Heb-9-17" id="en-CEV-28006"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>In other words, a will doesn't go into effect as long as the one who made it is still alive.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-9-18" id="en-CEV-28007"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Blood was also used<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28007g" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28007g" title="See footnote g"&gt;g&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28007g" title="See footnote g">g</a>]</sup> to put the first agreement into effect. </span> <span class="text Heb-9-19" id="en-CEV-28008"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup> Moses told the people all the Law said they must do. Then he used red wool and a hyssop plant to sprinkle the people and the book of the Law with the blood of bulls and goats<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28008h" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28008h" title="See footnote h"&gt;h&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28008h" title="See footnote h">h</a>]</sup> and with water. </span> <span class="text Heb-9-20" id="en-CEV-28009"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>He told the people, “With this blood God makes his agreement with you.” </span> <span class="text Heb-9-21" id="en-CEV-28010"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup> Moses also sprinkled blood on the tent and on everything else used in worship. </span> <span class="text Heb-9-22" id="en-CEV-28011"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup> The Law says that almost everything must be sprinkled with blood, and no sins can be forgiven unless blood is offered.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Heb-9-23" id="en-CEV-28012">Christ's Great Sacrifice</span></h3><p><span class="text Heb-9-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>These things are only copies of what is in heaven, and so they had to be made holy by these ceremonies. But the real things in heaven must be made holy by something better. </span> <span class="text Heb-9-24" id="en-CEV-28013"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>This is why Christ did not go into a tent made by humans and was only a copy of the real one. Instead, he went into heaven and is now there with God to help us.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-9-25" id="en-CEV-28014"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Christ did not have to offer himself many times. He wasn't like a high priest who goes into the most holy place each year to offer the blood of an animal. </span> <span class="text Heb-9-26" id="en-CEV-28015"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>If he had offered himself every year, he would have suffered many times since the creation of the world. But instead, near the end of time he offered himself once and for all, so he could be a sacrifice that does away with sin.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-9-27" id="en-CEV-28016"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>We die only once, and then we are judged. </span> <span class="text Heb-9-28" id="en-CEV-28017"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup> So Christ died only once to take away the sins of many people. But when he comes again, it will not be to take away sin. He will come to save everyone who is waiting for him.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
