<p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Heb-6-1" id="en-CEV-27932"><span class="chapternum">6 </span>We must try to become mature and start thinking about more than just the basic things we were taught about Christ. We shouldn't need to keep talking about why we ought to turn from deeds that bring death and why we ought to have faith in God. </span> <span class="text Heb-6-2" id="en-CEV-27933"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>And we shouldn't need to keep teaching about baptisms<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27933a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27933a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27933a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> or about the laying on of hands<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27933b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27933b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27933b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> or about people being raised from death and the future judgment. </span> <span class="text Heb-6-3" id="en-CEV-27934"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Let's grow up, if God is willing.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-6-4-Heb-6-6" id="en-CEV-27935"><sup class="versenum">4-6 </sup>But what about people who turn away after they have already seen the light and have received the gift from heaven and have shared in the Holy Spirit? What about those who turn away after they have received the good message of God and the powers of the future world? There is no way to bring them back. What they are doing is the same as nailing the Son of God to a cross and insulting him in public!</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-6-7" id="en-CEV-27936"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>A field is useful to farmers, if there is enough rain to make good crops grow. In fact, God will bless such a field. </span> <span class="text Heb-6-8" id="en-CEV-27937"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup> But land that produces only thornbushes is worthless. It is likely to fall under God's curse, and in the end it will be set on fire.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-6-9" id="en-CEV-27938"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>My friends, we are talking this way. But we are sure that you are doing those really good things people do when they are being saved. </span> <span class="text Heb-6-10" id="en-CEV-27939"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>God is always fair. He will remember how you helped his people in the past and how you are still helping them. You belong to God, and he won't forget the love you have shown his people. </span> <span class="text Heb-6-11" id="en-CEV-27940"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>We wish each of you would always be eager to show how strong and lasting your hope really is. </span> <span class="text Heb-6-12" id="en-CEV-27941"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Then you would never be lazy. You would be following the example of those who had faith and were patient until God kept his promise to them.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Heb-6-13" id="en-CEV-27942">God's Promise Is Sure</span></h3><p><span class="text Heb-6-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>No one is greater than God. So he made a promise in his own name when he said to Abraham, </span> <span class="text Heb-6-14" id="en-CEV-27943"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup> “I, the Lord, will bless you with many descendants!” </span> <span class="text Heb-6-15" id="en-CEV-27944"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Then after Abraham had been very patient, he was given what God had promised. </span> <span class="text Heb-6-16" id="en-CEV-27945"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>When anyone wants to settle an argument, they make a vow by using the name of someone or something greater than themselves. </span> <span class="text Heb-6-17" id="en-CEV-27946"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>So when God wanted to prove for certain his promise to his people could not be broken, he made a vow. </span> <span class="text Heb-6-18" id="en-CEV-27947"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>God cannot tell lies! And so his promises and vows are two things that can never be changed.</span></p><p><span class="text Heb-6-18">We have run to God for safety. Now his promises should greatly encourage us to take hold of the hope that is right in front of us. </span> <span class="text Heb-6-19" id="en-CEV-27948"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup> This hope is like a firm and steady anchor for our souls. In fact, hope reaches behind the curtain<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27948c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27948c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27948c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> and into the most holy place. </span> <span class="text Heb-6-20" id="en-CEV-27949"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup> Jesus has gone there ahead of us, and he is our high priest forever, just like Melchizedek.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27949d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27949d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27949d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup></span></p> <div class="footnotes">
