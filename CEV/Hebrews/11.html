<h3><span class="text Heb-11-1" id="en-CEV-28056">The Great Faith of God's People</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Heb-11-1"><span class="chapternum">11 </span>Faith makes us sure of what we hope for and gives us proof of what we cannot see. </span> <span class="text Heb-11-2" id="en-CEV-28057"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup> It was their faith that made our ancestors pleasing to God.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-11-3" id="en-CEV-28058"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup> Because of our faith, we know that the world was made at God's command. We also know that what can be seen was made out of what cannot be seen.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-11-4" id="en-CEV-28059"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup> Because Abel had faith, he offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did. God was pleased with him and his gift, and even though Abel is now dead, his faith still speaks for him.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-11-5" id="en-CEV-28060"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup> Enoch had faith and did not die. He pleased God, and God took him up to heaven. This is why his body was never found. </span> <span class="text Heb-11-6" id="en-CEV-28061"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>But without faith no one can please God. We must believe that God is real and rewards everyone who searches for him.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-11-7" id="en-CEV-28062"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup> Because Noah had faith, he was warned about something that had not yet happened. He obeyed and built a boat that saved him and his family. In this way the people of the world were judged, and Noah was given the blessings that come to everyone who pleases God.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-11-8" id="en-CEV-28063"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup> Abraham had faith and obeyed God. He was told to go to the land that God had said would be his, and he left for a country he had never seen. </span> <span class="text Heb-11-9" id="en-CEV-28064"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup> Because Abraham had faith, he lived as a stranger in the promised land. He lived there in a tent, and so did Isaac and Jacob, who were later given the same promise. </span> <span class="text Heb-11-10" id="en-CEV-28065"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Abraham did this, because he was waiting for the eternal city God had planned and built.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-11-11" id="en-CEV-28066"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup> Even when Sarah was too old to have children, she had faith that God would do what he had promised, and she had a son. </span> <span class="text Heb-11-12" id="en-CEV-28067"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup> Her husband Abraham was almost dead, but he became the ancestor of many people. In fact, there are as many of them as there are stars in the sky or grains of sand along the seashore.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-11-13" id="en-CEV-28068"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup> Every one of those people died. But they still had faith, even though they had not received what they had been promised. They were glad just to see these things from far away, and they agreed that they were only strangers and foreigners on this earth. </span> <span class="text Heb-11-14" id="en-CEV-28069"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>When people talk this way, it is clear they are looking for a place to call their own. </span> <span class="text Heb-11-15" id="en-CEV-28070"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>If they had been talking about the land where they had once lived, they could have gone back at any time. </span> <span class="text Heb-11-16" id="en-CEV-28071"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>But they were looking forward to a better home in heaven. This is why God wasn't ashamed for them to call him their God. He even built a city for them.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-11-17-Heb-11-18" id="en-CEV-28072"><sup class="versenum">17-18 </sup> Abraham had been promised that Isaac, his only son,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28072a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28072a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28072a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> would continue his family. But when Abraham was tested, he had faith and was willing to sacrifice Isaac, </span> <span class="text Heb-11-19" id="en-CEV-28073"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>because he was sure that God could raise people to life. This was just like getting Isaac back from death.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-11-20" id="en-CEV-28074"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup> Isaac had faith, and he promised blessings to Jacob and Esau. </span> <span class="text Heb-11-21" id="en-CEV-28075"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup> Later, when Jacob was about to die, he leaned on his walking stick and worshiped. Then because of his faith he blessed each of Joseph's sons. </span> <span class="text Heb-11-22" id="en-CEV-28076"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup> And right before Joseph died, he had faith that God would lead the people of Israel out of Egypt. So he told them to take his bones with them.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-11-23" id="en-CEV-28077"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup> Because Moses' parents had faith, they kept him hidden until he was three months old. They saw that he was a beautiful child, and they were not afraid to disobey the king's orders.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28077b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28077b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28077b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Heb-11-24" id="en-CEV-28078"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup> Then after Moses grew up, his faith made him refuse to be called the king's grandson. </span> <span class="text Heb-11-25" id="en-CEV-28079"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup> He chose to be mistreated with God's people instead of having the good time that sin could bring for a little while. </span> <span class="text Heb-11-26" id="en-CEV-28080"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>Moses knew that the treasures of Egypt were not as wonderful as what he would receive from suffering for the Messiah,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28080c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28080c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28080c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> and he looked forward to his reward.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-11-27" id="en-CEV-28081"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>Because of his faith, Moses left Egypt. Moses had seen the invisible God and wasn't afraid of the king's anger. </span> <span class="text Heb-11-28" id="en-CEV-28082"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup> His faith also made him celebrate Passover. He sprinkled the blood of animals on the doorposts, so that the first-born sons of the people of Israel would not be killed by the destroying angel.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-11-29" id="en-CEV-28083"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup> Because of their faith, the people walked through the Red Sea<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28083d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28083d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28083d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> on dry land. But when the Egyptians tried to do it, they were drowned.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-11-30" id="en-CEV-28084"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup> God's people had faith, and when they had walked around the city of Jericho for seven days, its walls fell down.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-11-31" id="en-CEV-28085"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup> Rahab had been a prostitute, but she had faith and welcomed the spies. So she wasn't killed with the people who disobeyed.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-11-32" id="en-CEV-28086"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup> What else can I say? There isn't enough time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets. </span> <span class="text Heb-11-33" id="en-CEV-28087"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup> Their faith helped them conquer kingdoms, and because they did right, God made promises to them. They closed the jaws of lions </span> <span class="text Heb-11-34" id="en-CEV-28088"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup> and put out raging fires and escaped from the swords of their enemies. Although they were weak, they were given the strength and power to chase foreign armies away.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-11-35" id="en-CEV-28089"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup> Some women received their loved ones back from death. Many of these people were tortured, but they refused to be released. They were sure they would get a better reward when the dead are raised to life. </span> <span class="text Heb-11-36" id="en-CEV-28090"><sup class="versenum">36 </sup> Others were made fun of and beaten with whips, and some were chained in jail. </span> <span class="text Heb-11-37" id="en-CEV-28091"><sup class="versenum">37 </sup> Still others were stoned to death or sawed in two<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28091e" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28091e" title="See footnote e"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28091e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> or killed with swords.

They were poor, mistreated, and tortured. </span> <span class="text Heb-11-38" id="en-CEV-28092"><sup class="versenum">38 </sup>The world did not deserve these good people, who had to wander in deserts and on mountains and had to live in caves and holes in the ground.</span></p> <p><span class="text Heb-11-39" id="en-CEV-28093"><sup class="versenum">39 </sup>All of them pleased God because of their faith! But still they died without being given what had been promised. </span> <span class="text Heb-11-40" id="en-CEV-28094"><sup class="versenum">40 </sup>This was because God had something better in store for us. And he did not want them to reach the goal of their faith without us.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
