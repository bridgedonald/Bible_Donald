And God never tells a lie! </span> <span class="text Titus-1-3" id="en-CEV-27782"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>So, at the proper time, God our Savior gave this message and told me to announce what he had said.</span></p> <p><span class="text Titus-1-4" id="en-CEV-27783"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup> Titus, because of our faith, you are like a son to me. I pray that God our Father and Christ Jesus our Savior will be kind to you and will bless you with peace!</span></p> <h3><span class="text Titus-1-5" id="en-CEV-27784">What Titus Was To Do in Crete</span></h3><p><span class="text Titus-1-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>I left you in Crete to do what had been left undone and to appoint leaders<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27784a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27784a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27784a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> for the churches in each town.

They must not be bossy, quick-tempered, heavy drinkers, bullies, or dishonest in business. </span> <span class="text Titus-1-8" id="en-CEV-27787"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Instead, they must be friendly to strangers and enjoy doing good things. They must also be sensible, fair, pure, and self-controlled. </span> <span class="text Titus-1-9" id="en-CEV-27788"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>They must stick to the true message they were taught, so their good teaching can help others and correct everyone who opposes it.</span></p> <p><span class="text Titus-1-10" id="en-CEV-27789"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>There are many who don't respect authority, and they fool others by talking nonsense. This is especially true of some Jewish followers. </span> <span class="text Titus-1-11" id="en-CEV-27790"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>But you must make them be quiet. They are after money, and they upset whole families by teaching what they should not. </span> <span class="text Titus-1-12" id="en-CEV-27791"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>It is like one of their own prophets once said,</span></p><div class="poetry"><p class="line"><span class="text Titus-1-12">“The people of Crete</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Titus-1-12">always tell lies.</span></span><br/><span class="text Titus-1-12">They are greedy and lazy</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Titus-1-12">like wild animals.”</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1"><span class="text Titus-1-13" id="en-CEV-27792"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>This surely is a true saying. And you should be hard on such people, so you can help them grow stronger in their faith. </span> <span class="text Titus-1-14" id="en-CEV-27793"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Don't pay any attention to any of those senseless Jewish stories and human commands.
