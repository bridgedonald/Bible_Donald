<p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Col-2-1" id="en-CEV-27383"><span class="chapternum">2 </span>I want you to know what a struggle I am going through for you, for God's people at Laodicea, and for all of those followers who have never met me. </span> <span class="text Col-2-2" id="en-CEV-27384"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>I do it to encourage them. Then as their hearts are joined together in love, they will be wonderfully blessed with complete understanding. And they will truly know Christ. Not only is he the key to God's mystery, </span> <span class="text Col-2-3" id="en-CEV-27385"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>but all wisdom and knowledge are hidden away in him. </span> <span class="text Col-2-4" id="en-CEV-27386"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>I tell you these things to keep you from being fooled by fancy talk. </span> <span class="text Col-2-5" id="en-CEV-27387"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Even though I am not with you, I keep thinking about you. I am glad to know that you are living as you should and your faith in Christ is strong.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Col-2-6" id="en-CEV-27388">Christ Brings Real Life</span></h3><p><span class="text Col-2-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>You have accepted Christ Jesus as your Lord. Now keep on following him. </span> <span class="text Col-2-7" id="en-CEV-27389"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Plant your roots in Christ and let him be the foundation for your life. Be strong in your faith, just as you were taught. And be grateful.</span></p> <p><span class="text Col-2-8" id="en-CEV-27390"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Don't let anyone fool you by using senseless arguments. These arguments may sound wise, but they are only human teachings. They come from the powers of this world<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27390a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27390a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27390a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> and not from Christ.</span></p> <p><span class="text Col-2-9" id="en-CEV-27391"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>God lives fully in Christ. </span> <span class="text Col-2-10" id="en-CEV-27392"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>And you are fully grown because you belong to Christ, who is over every power and authority. </span> <span class="text Col-2-11" id="en-CEV-27393"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Christ has also taken away your selfish desires, just as circumcision removes flesh from the body. </span> <span class="text Col-2-12" id="en-CEV-27394"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup> And when you were baptized, it was the same as being buried with Christ. Then you were raised to life because you had faith in the power of God, who raised Christ from death. </span> <span class="text Col-2-13" id="en-CEV-27395"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup> You were dead, because you were sinful and were not God's people. But God let Christ make you<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27395b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27395b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27395b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> alive, when he forgave all our sins.</span></p> <p><span class="text Col-2-14" id="en-CEV-27396"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup> God wiped out the charges that were against us for disobeying the Law of Moses. He took them away and nailed them to the cross. </span> <span class="text Col-2-15" id="en-CEV-27397"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>There Christ defeated all powers and forces. He let the whole world see them being led away as prisoners when he celebrated his victory.</span></p> <p><span class="text Col-2-16" id="en-CEV-27398"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup> Don't let anyone tell you what you must eat or drink. Don't let them say you must celebrate the New Moon festival, the Sabbath, or any other festival. </span> <span class="text Col-2-17" id="en-CEV-27399"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>These things are only a shadow of what was to come. But Christ is real!</span></p> <p><span class="text Col-2-18" id="en-CEV-27400"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Don't be cheated by people who make a show of acting humble and who worship angels.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27400c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27400c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27400c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> They brag about seeing visions. But it is all nonsense, because their minds are filled with selfish desires. </span> <span class="text Col-2-19" id="en-CEV-27401"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup> They are no longer part of Christ, who is the head of the whole body. Christ gives the body its strength, and he uses its joints and muscles to hold it together, as it grows by the power of God.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Col-2-20" id="en-CEV-27402">Christ Brings New Life</span></h3><p><span class="text Col-2-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>You died with Christ.

Don't touch this.”? </span> <span class="text Col-2-22" id="en-CEV-27404"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>After these things are used, they are no longer good for anything. So why be bothered with the rules that humans have made up? </span> <span class="text Col-2-23" id="en-CEV-27405"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>Obeying these rules may seem to be the smart thing to do. They appear to make you love God more and to be very humble and to have control over your body. But they don't really have any power over our desires.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
