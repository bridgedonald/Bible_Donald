<h3><span class="text Num-11-1" id="en-CEV-3471">The Israelites Complain</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Num-11-1"><span class="chapternum">11 </span>One day the Israelites started complaining about their troubles. The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> heard them and became so angry that he destroyed the outer edges of their camp with fire.</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-11-2" id="en-CEV-3472"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>When the people begged Moses to help, he prayed, and the fire went out. </span> <span class="text Num-11-3" id="en-CEV-3473"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>They named the place “Burning,”<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-3473a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-3473a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-3473a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> because in his anger the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had set their camp on fire.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Num-11-4" id="en-CEV-3474">The People Grumble about Being Hungry</span></h3><p><span class="text Num-11-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>One day some foreigners among the Israelites became greedy for food, and even the Israelites themselves began moaning, “We don't have any meat! </span> <span class="text Num-11-5" id="en-CEV-3475"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>In Egypt we could eat all the fish we wanted, and there were cucumbers, melons, all kinds of onions, and garlic. </span> <span class="text Num-11-6" id="en-CEV-3476"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>But we're starving out here, and the only food we have is this manna.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-11-7" id="en-CEV-3477"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup> The manna was like small whitish seeds </span> <span class="text Num-11-8-Num-11-9" id="en-CEV-3478"><sup class="versenum">8-9 </sup> and tasted like something baked with sweet olive oil. It appeared at night with the dew. In the morning the people would collect the manna, grind or crush it into flour, then boil it and make it into thin wafers.</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-11-10" id="en-CEV-3479"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>The Israelites stood around their tents complaining. Moses heard them and was upset that they had made the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> angry. </span> <span class="text Num-11-11" id="en-CEV-3480"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>He prayed:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Num-11-11">I am your servant, <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, so why are you doing this to me? What have I done to deserve this? You've made me responsible for all these people, </span> <span class="text Num-11-12" id="en-CEV-3481"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>but they're not my children. You told me to nurse them along and to carry them to the land you promised their ancestors. </span> <span class="text Num-11-13" id="en-CEV-3482"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>They keep whining for meat, but where can I get meat for them? </span> <span class="text Num-11-14" id="en-CEV-3483"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>This job is too much for me. How can I take care of all these people by myself? </span> <span class="text Num-11-15" id="en-CEV-3484"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>If this is the way you're going to treat me, just kill me now and end my miserable life!</span></p> <h3><span class="text Num-11-16" id="en-CEV-3485">Seventy Leaders Are Chosen To Help Moses</span></h3><p><span class="text Num-11-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Num-11-16">Choose 70 of Israel's respected leaders and go with them to the sacred tent. </span> <span class="text Num-11-17" id="en-CEV-3486"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>While I am talking with you there, I will give them some of your authority, so they can share responsibility for my people. You will no longer have to care for them by yourself.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Num-11-18" id="en-CEV-3487"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>As for the Israelites, I have heard them complaining about not having meat and about being better off in Egypt. So tell them to make themselves acceptable to me, because tomorrow they will have meat. </span> <span class="text Num-11-19-Num-11-20" id="en-CEV-3488"><sup class="versenum">19-20 </sup>In fact, they will have meat day after day for a whole month—not just a few days, or even 10 or 20. They turned against me and wanted to go back to Egypt. Now they will eat meat until they get sick of it.</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-11-21" id="en-CEV-3489"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Moses replied, “At least 600,000 grown men are here with me. How can you say there will be enough meat to feed them and their families for a whole month? </span> <span class="text Num-11-22" id="en-CEV-3490"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Even if we butchered all our sheep and cattle, or caught every fish in the sea, we wouldn't have enough to feed them.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-11-23" id="en-CEV-3491"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> answered, “I can do anything! Watch and you'll see my words come true.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-11-24" id="en-CEV-3492"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>Moses told the people what the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had said. Then he chose 70 respected leaders and went with them to the sacred tent. While the leaders stood in a circle around the tent, Moses went inside, </span> <span class="text Num-11-25" id="en-CEV-3493"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>and the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> spoke with him. Then the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> took some authority<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-3493b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-3493b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-3493b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> from Moses and gave it to the 70 leaders. And when the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s Spirit took control of them, they started shouting like prophets. But they did it only this one time.</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-11-26" id="en-CEV-3494"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>Eldad and Medad were two leaders who had not gone to the tent. But when the Spirit took control of them, they began shouting like prophets right there in camp. </span> <span class="text Num-11-27" id="en-CEV-3495"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>A boy ran to Moses and told him about Eldad and Medad.</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-11-28" id="en-CEV-3496"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>Joshua<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-3496c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-3496c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-3496c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> was there helping Moses, as he had done since he was young. And he said to Moses, “Sir, you must stop them!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-11-29" id="en-CEV-3497"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>But Moses replied, “Are you concerned what this might do to me? I wish the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> would give his Spirit to all his people so everyone could be a prophet.” </span> <span class="text Num-11-30" id="en-CEV-3498"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>Then Moses and the 70 leaders went back to camp.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Num-11-31" id="en-CEV-3499">The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> Sends Quails</span></h3><p><span class="text Num-11-31"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>Some time later the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> sent a strong wind that blew quails in from the sea until Israel's camp was completely surrounded with birds, piled up about a meter high for many kilometers in every direction. </span> <span class="text Num-11-32" id="en-CEV-3500"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>The people picked up quails for two days—each person filled at least ten large baskets. Then they spread them out to dry. </span> <span class="text Num-11-33" id="en-CEV-3501"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>But before the meat could be eaten, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> became angry and sent a deadly disease through the camp.</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-11-34" id="en-CEV-3502"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>After they had buried the people who had been so greedy for meat, they called the place “Graves for the Greedy.”<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-3502d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-3502d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-3502d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text Num-11-35" id="en-CEV-3503"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>Israel then broke camp and traveled to Hazeroth.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
