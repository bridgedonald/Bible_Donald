<h3><span class="text Num-6-1" id="en-CEV-3355">Rules for Nazirites</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Num-6-1"><span class="chapternum">6 </span>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> told Moses </span> <span class="text Num-6-2" id="en-CEV-3356"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>to say to the people of Israel:</span></p><p><span class="text Num-6-2">If any of you want to dedicate yourself to me by vowing to become a Nazirite, </span> <span class="text Num-6-3" id="en-CEV-3357"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup> you must no longer drink any wine or beer or use any kind of vinegar. Don't drink grape juice or eat grapes or raisins—</span> <span class="text Num-6-4" id="en-CEV-3358"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>not even the seeds or skins.</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-6-5" id="en-CEV-3359"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>The hair of a Nazirite is sacred to me, and as long as you are a Nazirite, you must never cut your hair.</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-6-6" id="en-CEV-3360"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>During the time that you are a Nazirite, you must never go close to a dead body, </span> <span class="text Num-6-7-Num-6-8" id="en-CEV-3361"><sup class="versenum">7-8 </sup>not even that of your father, mother, brother, or sister. That would make you unclean. Your hair is the sign that you are dedicated to me, so remain holy.</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-6-9" id="en-CEV-3362"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>If someone suddenly dies near you, your hair is no longer sacred, and you must shave it seven days later during the ceremony to make you clean. </span> <span class="text Num-6-10" id="en-CEV-3363"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Then on the next day, bring two doves or two pigeons to the priest at the sacred tent. </span> <span class="text Num-6-11" id="en-CEV-3364"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>He will offer one of the birds as a sacrifice for sin and the other as a sacrifice to please me.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-3364a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-3364a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-3364a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> You will then be forgiven for being too near a dead body, and your hair will again become sacred. </span> <span class="text Num-6-12" id="en-CEV-3365"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>But the dead body made you unacceptable, so you must make another vow to become a Nazirite and be dedicated once more. Finally, a year-old ram must be offered as the sacrifice to make things right.</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-6-13" id="en-CEV-3366"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup> When you have completed your promised time of being a Nazirite, go to the sacred tent </span> <span class="text Num-6-14" id="en-CEV-3367"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>and offer three animals that have nothing wrong with them: a year-old ram as a sacrifice to please me, a year-old female lamb as a sacrifice for sin, and a full-grown ram as a sacrifice to ask my blessing.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-3367b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-3367b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-3367b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Num-6-15" id="en-CEV-3368"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Wine offerings and grain sacrifices must also be brought with these animals. Finally, you are to bring a basket of bread made with your finest flour and olive oil, but without yeast. Also bring some thin wafers brushed with oil.</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-6-16" id="en-CEV-3369"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>The priest will take these gifts to my altar and offer them, so that I will be pleased and will forgive you. </span> <span class="text Num-6-17" id="en-CEV-3370"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Then he will sacrifice the ram and offer the wine, grain, and bread.</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-6-18" id="en-CEV-3371"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>After that, you will stand at the entrance to the sacred tent, shave your head, and put the hair in the fire where the priest has offered the sacrifice to ask my blessing.</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-6-19" id="en-CEV-3372"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Once the meat from the ram's shoulder has been boiled, the priest will take it, along with one loaf of bread and one wafer brushed with oil, and give them to you. </span> <span class="text Num-6-20" id="en-CEV-3373"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>You will hand them back to the priest, who will lift them up<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-3373c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-3373c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-3373c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> in dedication to me. Then he can eat the meat from the ram's shoulder, its choice ribs, and its hind leg, because this is his share of the sacrifice. After this, you will no longer be a Nazirite, and you will be free to drink wine.</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-6-21" id="en-CEV-3374"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>These are the requirements for Nazirites. However, if you can afford to offer more, you must do so.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Num-6-22" id="en-CEV-3375">The Blessing for the People</span></h3><p><span class="text Num-6-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> told Moses, </span> <span class="text Num-6-23" id="en-CEV-3376"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>“When Aaron and his sons bless the people of Israel, they must say:</span></p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line"><span class="text Num-6-24" id="en-CEV-3377"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>I pray that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Num-6-24">will bless and protect you,</span></span><br/><span class="text Num-6-25" id="en-CEV-3378"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>and that he will show you mercy</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Num-6-25">and kindness.</span></span><br/><span class="text Num-6-26" id="en-CEV-3379"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>May the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> be good to you</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Num-6-26">and give you peace.”</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1"><span class="text Num-6-27" id="en-CEV-3380"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>Then the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said, “If Aaron and his sons ask me to bless the Israelites, I will give them my blessing.”</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
