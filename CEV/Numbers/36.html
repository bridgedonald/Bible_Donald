And the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has commanded you to give the daughters of our relative Zelophehad<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-4162b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-4162b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-4162b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> the land that he would have received. </span> <span class="text Num-36-3" id="en-CEV-4163"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>But if they marry men from other tribes of Israel, the land they receive will become part of that tribe's inheritance and will no longer belong to us. </span> <span class="text Num-36-4" id="en-CEV-4164"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Even when land is returned to its original owner in the Year of Celebration,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-4164c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-4164c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-4164c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> we will not get back Zelophehad's land—it will belong to the tribe into which his daughters married.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-36-5" id="en-CEV-4165"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>So Moses told the people that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Num-36-5">These men from the Manasseh tribe are right. </span> <span class="text Num-36-6" id="en-CEV-4166"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>I will allow Zelophehad's daughters to marry anyone, as long as those men belong to one of the clans of the Manasseh tribe.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Num-36-7" id="en-CEV-4167"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Tribal land must not be given to another tribe—it will remain the property of the tribe that received it. </span> <span class="text Num-36-8-Num-36-9" id="en-CEV-4168"><sup class="versenum">8-9 </sup>In the future, any daughter who inherits land must marry someone from her own tribe.

So the property could not be returned even during this year.</span></li>
