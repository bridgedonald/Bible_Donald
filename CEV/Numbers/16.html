<h3><span class="text Num-16-1-Num-16-2" id="en-CEV-3607">Korah, Dathan, and Abiram Lead a Rebellion</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Num-16-1-Num-16-2"><span class="chapternum">16 </span><sup class="versenum">1-2 </sup> Korah son of Izhar was a Levite from the Kohathite clan. One day he called together Dathan, Abiram, and On<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-3607a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-3607a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-3607a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> from the Reuben tribe, and the four of them decided to rebel against Moses. So they asked 250 respected Israelite leaders for their support, and together they went to Moses </span> <span class="text Num-16-3" id="en-CEV-3608"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>and Aaron and said, “Why do you think you're so much better than everyone else? We're part of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s holy people, and he's with all of us. What makes you think you're the only ones in charge?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-16-4" id="en-CEV-3609"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>When Moses heard this, he knelt down to pray.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-3609b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-3609b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-3609b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Num-16-5" id="en-CEV-3610"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Then he said to Korah and his followers:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Num-16-5">Tomorrow morning the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will show us the person he has chosen to be his priest, and that man will faithfully serve him.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Num-16-6-Num-16-7" id="en-CEV-3611"><sup class="versenum">6-7 </sup>Korah, here is what you and your followers must do: Get some fire pans, fill them with coals and incense, and place them near the sacred tent. And the man the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> chooses will be his priest.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-3611c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-3611c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-3611c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> Korah, this time you Levites have gone too far!</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Num-16-8-Num-16-9" id="en-CEV-3612"><sup class="versenum">8-9 </sup>You know that the God of Israel has chosen you Levites from all Israel to serve him by being in charge of the sacred tent and by helping the community to worship in the proper way. What more do you want? </span> <span class="text Num-16-10" id="en-CEV-3613"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has given you a special responsibility, and now, Korah, you think you should also be his priest. </span> <span class="text Num-16-11" id="en-CEV-3614"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>You and your followers have rebelled against the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, not against Aaron.</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-16-12" id="en-CEV-3615"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Then Moses sent for Dathan and Abiram, but they sent back this message: “We won't come! </span> <span class="text Num-16-13" id="en-CEV-3616"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>It's bad enough that you took us from our rich farmland in Egypt to let us die here in the desert. Now you also want to boss us around! </span> <span class="text Num-16-14" id="en-CEV-3617"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>You keep promising us rich farmlands with fertile fields and vineyards—but where are they? Stop trying to trick these people. No, we won't come to see you.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-16-15" id="en-CEV-3618"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Moses was very angry and said to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, “Don't listen to these men! I haven't done anything wrong to them. I haven't taken as much as a donkey.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-16-16" id="en-CEV-3619"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Then he said to Korah, “Tomorrow you and your followers must go with Aaron to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s sacred tent. </span> <span class="text Num-16-17" id="en-CEV-3620"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Each of you take along your fire pan with incense in it and offer the incense to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-16-18" id="en-CEV-3621"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>The next day the men placed incense and coals in their fire pans and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the sacred tent. </span> <span class="text Num-16-19" id="en-CEV-3622"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Meanwhile, Korah had convinced the rest of the Israelites to rebel against their two leaders.</span></p><p><span class="text Num-16-19">When that happened, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> appeared in all his glory </span> <span class="text Num-16-20" id="en-CEV-3623"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>and said to Moses and Aaron, </span> <span class="text Num-16-21" id="en-CEV-3624"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>“Get away from the rest of the Israelites so I can kill them at once!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-16-22" id="en-CEV-3625"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>But the two men bowed down and prayed, “Our God, you gave these people life. Why would you punish everyone here when only one man has sinned?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-16-23" id="en-CEV-3626"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> answered Moses, </span> <span class="text Num-16-24" id="en-CEV-3627"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>“Tell the people to stay away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-16-25" id="en-CEV-3628"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Moses walked over to Dathan and Abiram, and the other leaders of Israel followed. </span> <span class="text Num-16-26" id="en-CEV-3629"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>Then Moses warned the people, “Get away from the tents of these sinful men! Don't touch anything that belongs to them or you'll be wiped out.” </span> <span class="text Num-16-27" id="en-CEV-3630"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>So everyone moved away from those tents, except Korah, Dathan, Abiram, and their families.</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-16-28" id="en-CEV-3631"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>Moses said to the crowd, “The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has chosen me and told me to do these things—it wasn't my idea. And here's how you will know: </span> <span class="text Num-16-29" id="en-CEV-3632"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>If these men die a natural death, it means the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> hasn't chosen me. </span> <span class="text Num-16-30" id="en-CEV-3633"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>But suppose the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> does something that has never been done before. For example, what if a huge crack appears in the ground, and these men and their families fall into it and are buried alive, together with everything they own? Then you will know they have turned their backs on the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-16-31" id="en-CEV-3634"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>As soon as Moses said this, the ground under the men opened up </span> <span class="text Num-16-32-Num-16-33" id="en-CEV-3635"><sup class="versenum">32-33 </sup>and swallowed them alive, together with their families and everything they owned. Then the ground closed back up, and they were gone.</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-16-34" id="en-CEV-3636"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>The rest of the Israelites heard their screams, so they ran off, shouting, “We don't want that to happen to us!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-16-35" id="en-CEV-3637"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>Suddenly the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> sent a fire that burned up the 250 men who had offered incense to him.</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-16-36" id="en-CEV-3638"><sup class="versenum">36 </sup>Then the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, </span> <span class="text Num-16-37" id="en-CEV-3639"><sup class="versenum">37 </sup>“Tell Aaron's son Eleazar to take the fire pans from the smoldering fire and scatter the coals. The pans are now sacred, </span> <span class="text Num-16-38" id="en-CEV-3640"><sup class="versenum">38 </sup>because they were used for offering incense to me. Have them hammered into a thin layer of bronze as a covering for the altar. Those men died because of their sin, and now their fire pans will become a warning for the rest of the community.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-16-39" id="en-CEV-3641"><sup class="versenum">39 </sup>Eleazar collected the pans and had them hammered into a thin layer of bronze as a covering for the altar, </span> <span class="text Num-16-40" id="en-CEV-3642"><sup class="versenum">40 </sup>just as the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had told Moses. The pans were a warning to the Israelites that only Aaron's descendants would be allowed to offer incense to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>. Anyone else who tried to would be punished like Korah and his followers.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Num-16-41" id="en-CEV-3643">The Israelites Rebel and Are Punished</span></h3><p><span class="text Num-16-41"><sup class="versenum">41 </sup>The next day the people of Israel again complained against Moses and Aaron, “The two of you killed some of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s people!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-16-42" id="en-CEV-3644"><sup class="versenum">42 </sup>As the people crowded around them, Moses and Aaron turned toward the sacred tent, and the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> appeared in his glory in the cloud covering the tent. </span> <span class="text Num-16-43" id="en-CEV-3645"><sup class="versenum">43 </sup>So Moses and Aaron walked to the front of the tent, </span> <span class="text Num-16-44" id="en-CEV-3646"><sup class="versenum">44 </sup> where the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to them, </span> <span class="text Num-16-45" id="en-CEV-3647"><sup class="versenum">45 </sup>“Stand back! I am going to wipe out these Israelites once and for all.”</span></p><p><span class="text Num-16-45">They immediately bowed down and prayed. </span> <span class="text Num-16-46" id="en-CEV-3648"><sup class="versenum">46 </sup>Then Moses told Aaron, “Grab your fire pan and fill it with hot coals from the altar. Put incense in it, then quickly take it to where the people are and offer it to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, so they can be forgiven. The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> is very angry, and people have already started dying!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-16-47-Num-16-48" id="en-CEV-3649"><sup class="versenum">47-48 </sup>Aaron did exactly what he had been told. He ran over to the crowd of people and stood between the dead bodies and the people who were still alive. He placed the incense on the pan, then offered it to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> and asked him to forgive the people's sin. The disease immediately stopped spreading, and no one else died from it. </span> <span class="text Num-16-49" id="en-CEV-3650"><sup class="versenum">49 </sup>But 14,700 Israelites were dead, not counting those who had died with Korah and his followers.</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-16-50" id="en-CEV-3651"><sup class="versenum">50 </sup>Aaron walked back and stood with Moses at the sacred tent.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
