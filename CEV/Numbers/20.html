<h3><span class="text Num-20-1" id="en-CEV-3714">Water from a Rock</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Num-20-1"><span class="chapternum">20 </span>The people of Israel arrived at the Zin Desert during the first month<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-3714a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-3714a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-3714a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> and set up camp near the town of Kadesh. It was there that Miriam died and was buried.</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-20-2" id="en-CEV-3715"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup> The Israelites had no water, so they went to Moses and Aaron </span> <span class="text Num-20-3" id="en-CEV-3716"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>and complained, “Moses, we'd be better off if we had died along with the others in front of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s sacred tent.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-3716b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-3716b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-3716b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Num-20-4" id="en-CEV-3717"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>You brought us into this desert, and now we and our livestock are going to die! </span> <span class="text Num-20-5" id="en-CEV-3718"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Egypt was better than this horrible place. At least there we had grain and figs and grapevines and pomegranates.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-3718c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-3718c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-3718c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> But now we don't even have any water.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-20-6" id="en-CEV-3719"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Moses and Aaron went to the entrance to the sacred tent, where they bowed down. The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> appeared to them in all of his glory </span> <span class="text Num-20-7-Num-20-8" id="en-CEV-3720"><sup class="versenum">7-8 </sup>and said, “Moses, get your walking stick.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-3720d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-3720d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-3720d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> Then you and Aaron call the people together and command that rock to give you water. That's how you will provide water for the people of Israel and their livestock.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-20-9" id="en-CEV-3721"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Moses obeyed and took his stick from the sacred tent. </span> <span class="text Num-20-10" id="en-CEV-3722"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>After he and Aaron had gathered the people around the rock, he said, “Look, you rebellious people, and you will see water flow from this rock!” </span> <span class="text Num-20-11" id="en-CEV-3723"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup> He raised his stick in the air and struck the rock two times. At once, water gushed from the rock, and the people and their livestock had water to drink.</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-20-12" id="en-CEV-3724"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>But the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses and Aaron, “Because you refused to believe in my power, these people did not respect me. And so, you will not be the ones to lead them into the land I have promised.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-20-13" id="en-CEV-3725"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>The Israelites had complained against the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, and he had shown them his holy power by giving them water to drink. So they named the place Meribah, which means “Complaining.”</span></p> <h3><span class="text Num-20-14" id="en-CEV-3726">Israel Isn't Allowed To Go through Edom</span></h3><p><span class="text Num-20-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Moses sent messengers from Israel's camp near Kadesh with this message for the king of Edom:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Num-20-14">We are Israelites, your own relatives, and we're sure you have heard the terrible things that have happened to us. </span> <span class="text Num-20-15" id="en-CEV-3727"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Our ancestors settled in Egypt and lived there a long time. But later the Egyptians were cruel to us, </span> <span class="text Num-20-16" id="en-CEV-3728"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>and when we begged our <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> for help, he answered our prayer and brought us out of that land.</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Num-20-16">Now we are camped at the border of your territory, near the town of Kadesh. </span> <span class="text Num-20-17" id="en-CEV-3729"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Please let us go through your country. We won't go near your fields or vineyards, and we won't drink any water from your wells. We will stay on the main road<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-3729e" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-3729e" title="See footnote e"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-3729e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> until we leave your territory.</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-20-18" id="en-CEV-3730"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>But the king of Edom answered, “No, I won't let you go through our country! And if you try, we will attack you.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-20-19" id="en-CEV-3731"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Moses sent back this message: “We promise to stay on the main road, and if any of us or our livestock drink your water, we will pay for it. We just want to pass through.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-20-20" id="en-CEV-3732"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>But the king insisted, “You can't go through our land!”</span></p><p><span class="text Num-20-20">Then Edom sent out its strongest troops </span> <span class="text Num-20-21" id="en-CEV-3733"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>to keep Israel from passing through its territory. So the Israelites had to go in another direction.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Num-20-22" id="en-CEV-3734">Aaron Dies</span></h3><p><span class="text Num-20-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>After the Israelites had left Kadesh and had gone as far as Mount Hor </span> <span class="text Num-20-23" id="en-CEV-3735"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>on the Edomite border, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said, </span> <span class="text Num-20-24" id="en-CEV-3736"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>“Aaron, this is where you will die. You and Moses disobeyed me at Meribah, and so you will not enter the land I promised the Israelites. </span> <span class="text Num-20-25" id="en-CEV-3737"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Moses, go with Aaron and his son Eleazar to the top of the mountain. </span> <span class="text Num-20-26" id="en-CEV-3738"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>Then take Aaron's priestly robe from him and place it on Eleazar. Aaron will die there.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-20-27" id="en-CEV-3739"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>Moses obeyed, and everyone watched as he and Aaron and Eleazar walked to the top of Mount Hor. </span> <span class="text Num-20-28" id="en-CEV-3740"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup> Moses then took the priestly robe from Aaron and placed it on Eleazar. Aaron died there.</span></p><p><span class="text Num-20-28">When Moses and Eleazar came down, </span> <span class="text Num-20-29" id="en-CEV-3741"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>the people knew that Aaron had died, and they mourned his death for 30 days.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
