<h3><span class="text Num-14-1" id="en-CEV-3537">The Israelites Rebel against Moses</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Num-14-1"><span class="chapternum">14 </span>After the Israelites heard the report from the twelve men who had explored Canaan, the people cried all night </span> <span class="text Num-14-2" id="en-CEV-3538"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>and complained to Moses and Aaron, “We wish we had died in Egypt or somewhere out here in the desert! </span> <span class="text Num-14-3" id="en-CEV-3539"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Is the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> leading us into Canaan, just to have us killed and our women and children captured? We'd be better off in Egypt.” </span> <span class="text Num-14-4" id="en-CEV-3540"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Then they said to one another, “Let's choose our own leader and go back.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-14-5" id="en-CEV-3541"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Moses and Aaron bowed down to pray in front of the crowd. </span> <span class="text Num-14-6" id="en-CEV-3542"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Joshua and Caleb tore their clothes in sorrow </span> <span class="text Num-14-7" id="en-CEV-3543"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>and said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Num-14-7">We saw the land ourselves, and it's very good. </span> <span class="text Num-14-8" id="en-CEV-3544"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>If we obey the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, he will surely give us that land rich with milk and honey. </span> <span class="text Num-14-9" id="en-CEV-3545"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup> So don't rebel. We have no reason to be afraid of the people who live there. The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> is on our side, and they won't stand a chance against us!</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-14-10" id="en-CEV-3546"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>The crowd threatened to stone Moses and Aaron to death. But just then, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> appeared in a cloud at the sacred tent.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Num-14-11" id="en-CEV-3547">Moses Prays for the People</span></h3><p><span class="text Num-14-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “I have done great things for these people, and they still reject me by refusing to believe in my power. </span> <span class="text Num-14-12" id="en-CEV-3548"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>So they will no longer be my people. I will destroy them, but I will make you the ancestor of a nation even stronger than theirs.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-14-13-Num-14-16" id="en-CEV-3549"><sup class="versenum">13-16 </sup> Moses replied:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Num-14-13-Num-14-16">With your mighty power you rescued your people from Egypt, so please don't destroy us here in the desert. If you do, the Egyptians will hear about it and tell the people of Canaan. Those Canaanites already know that we are your people, and that we see you face to face. And they have heard how you lead us with a thick cloud during the day and flaming fire at night. But if you kill us, they will claim it was because you weren't powerful enough to lead us into Canaan as you promised.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Num-14-17" id="en-CEV-3550"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Show us your great power, <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>.

So please forgive these people, just as you have forgiven them ever since they left Egypt.</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-14-20" id="en-CEV-3553"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Then the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Num-14-20">In answer to your prayer, I do forgive them. </span> <span class="text Num-14-21" id="en-CEV-3554"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup> But as surely as I live and my power has no limit, </span> <span class="text Num-14-22-Num-14-23" id="en-CEV-3555"><sup class="versenum">22-23 </sup>I swear that not one of these Israelites will enter the land I promised to give their ancestors.
