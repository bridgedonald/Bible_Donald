<p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Num-22-1" id="en-CEV-3777"><span class="chapternum">22 </span>Israel moved from there to the hills of Moab, where they camped across the Jordan River from the town of Jericho.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Num-22-2-Num-22-3" id="en-CEV-3778">King Balak of Moab Hires Balaam To Curse Israel</span></h3><p><span class="text Num-22-2-Num-22-3"><sup class="versenum">2-3 </sup>When King Balak<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-3778a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-3778a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-3778a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> of Moab and his people heard how many Israelites there were and what they had done to the Amorites, he and the Moabites were terrified and panicked. </span> <span class="text Num-22-4" id="en-CEV-3779"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>They said to the Midianite leaders, “That huge mob of Israelites will wipe out everything in sight, like a bull eating grass in a field.”</span></p><p><span class="text Num-22-4">So King Balak </span> <span class="text Num-22-5" id="en-CEV-3780"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup> sent a message to Balaam son of Beor who lived among his relatives in the town of Pethor near the Euphrates River. It said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Num-22-5">I need your help. A large group of people has come here from Egypt and settled near my territory. </span> <span class="text Num-22-6" id="en-CEV-3781"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>They are too powerful for us to defeat, so would you come and place a curse on them? Maybe then we can run them off. I know that anyone you bless will be successful, but anyone you curse will fail.</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-22-7" id="en-CEV-3782"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>The leaders of Moab and Midian left and took along money to pay Balaam. When they got to his house, they gave him Balak's message.</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-22-8" id="en-CEV-3783"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>“Spend the night here,” Balaam replied, “and tomorrow I will tell you the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s answer.” So the officials stayed at his house.</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-22-9" id="en-CEV-3784"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>During the night, God asked Balaam, “Who are these people at your house?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-22-10" id="en-CEV-3785"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>“They are messengers from King Balak of Moab,” Balaam answered. “He sent them </span> <span class="text Num-22-11" id="en-CEV-3786"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>to ask me to go to Moab and put a curse on the people who have come there from Egypt. They have settled everywhere around him, and he wants to run them off.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-22-12" id="en-CEV-3787"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>But God replied, “Don't go with Balak's messengers. I have blessed those people who have come from Egypt, so don't curse them.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-22-13" id="en-CEV-3788"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>The next morning, Balaam said to Balak's officials, “Go on back home. The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> says I cannot go with you.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-22-14" id="en-CEV-3789"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>The officials left and told Balak that Balaam refused to come.</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-22-15" id="en-CEV-3790"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Then Balak sent a larger group of officials, who were even more important than the first ones. </span> <span class="text Num-22-16" id="en-CEV-3791"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>They went to Balaam and told him that Balak had said, “Balaam, if you come to Moab, </span> <span class="text Num-22-17" id="en-CEV-3792"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>I'll pay you very well and do whatever you ask. Just come and place a curse on these people.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-22-18" id="en-CEV-3793"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Balaam answered, “Even if Balak offered me a palace full of silver or gold, I wouldn't do anything to disobey the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> my God. </span> <span class="text Num-22-19" id="en-CEV-3794"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>You are welcome to spend the night here, just as the others did. I will find out if the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has something else to say about this.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-22-20" id="en-CEV-3795"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>That night, God said, “Balaam, I'll let you go to Moab with Balak's messengers, but do only what I say.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-22-21" id="en-CEV-3796"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>So Balaam got up the next morning and saddled his donkey, then left with the Moabite officials.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Num-22-22" id="en-CEV-3797">Balaam and His Donkey Meet an Angel</span></h3><p><span class="text Num-22-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Balaam was riding his donkey to Moab, and two of his servants were with him. But God was angry that Balaam had gone, so one of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s angels stood in the road to stop him. </span> <span class="text Num-22-23" id="en-CEV-3798"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>When Balaam's donkey saw the angel standing there with a sword, it walked off the road and into an open field. Balaam had to beat the donkey to get it back on the road.</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-22-24" id="en-CEV-3799"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>Then the angel stood between two vineyards, in a narrow path with a stone wall on each side. </span> <span class="text Num-22-25" id="en-CEV-3800"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>When the donkey saw the angel, it walked so close to one of the walls that Balaam's foot scraped against the wall. Balaam beat the donkey again.</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-22-26" id="en-CEV-3801"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>The angel moved once more and stood in a spot so narrow that there was no room for the donkey to go around. </span> <span class="text Num-22-27" id="en-CEV-3802"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>So it just lay down. Balaam lost his temper, then picked up a stick and whacked the donkey.</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-22-28" id="en-CEV-3803"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>When that happened, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> told the donkey to speak, and it asked Balaam, “What have I done that made you beat me three times?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-22-29" id="en-CEV-3804"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>“You made me look stupid!” Balaam answered. “If I had a sword, I'd kill you here and now!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-22-30" id="en-CEV-3805"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>“But you're my owner,” answered the donkey, “and you've ridden me many times. Have I ever done anything like this before?”</span></p><p><span class="text Num-22-30">“No,” Balaam admitted.</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-22-31" id="en-CEV-3806"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>Just then, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> let Balaam see the angel standing in the road, holding a sword, and Balaam bowed down.</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-22-32" id="en-CEV-3807"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>The angel said, “You had no right to treat your donkey like that! I was the one who blocked your way, because I don't think you should go to Moab.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-3807b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-3807b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-3807b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Num-22-33" id="en-CEV-3808"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>If your donkey had not seen me and stopped those three times, I would have killed you and let the donkey live.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-22-34" id="en-CEV-3809"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>Balaam replied, “I was wrong. I didn't know you were trying to stop me. If you don't think I should go, I'll return home at once.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-22-35" id="en-CEV-3810"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>“It's all right for you to go,” the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s angel answered. “But you must say only what I tell you.” So Balaam went on with Balak's officials.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Num-22-36" id="en-CEV-3811">King Balak Meets Balaam</span></h3><p><span class="text Num-22-36"><sup class="versenum">36 </sup>When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went to meet him at the town of Ir on the Arnon River, which is the northern border of Moab. </span> <span class="text Num-22-37" id="en-CEV-3812"><sup class="versenum">37 </sup>Balak asked, “Why didn't you come when I invited you the first time? Did you think I wasn't going to pay you?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-22-38" id="en-CEV-3813"><sup class="versenum">38 </sup>“I'm here now,” Balaam answered. “But I will say only what God tells me to say.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-22-39" id="en-CEV-3814"><sup class="versenum">39 </sup>They left and went to the town of Kiriath-Huzoth, </span> <span class="text Num-22-40" id="en-CEV-3815"><sup class="versenum">40 </sup>where Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep and gave some of the meat to Balaam and the officials who were with him.</span></p> <p><span class="text Num-22-41" id="en-CEV-3816"><sup class="versenum">41 </sup>The next morning, Balak took Balaam to the town of Bamoth-Baal.
