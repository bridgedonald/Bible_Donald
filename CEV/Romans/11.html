<h3><span class="text Rom-11-1" id="en-CEV-26115">God Has Not Rejected His People</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Rom-11-1"><span class="chapternum">11 </span> Am I saying that God has turned his back on his people? Certainly not! I am one of the people of Israel, and I myself am a descendant of Abraham from the tribe of Benjamin. </span> <span class="text Rom-11-2" id="en-CEV-26116"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>God did not turn his back on his chosen people. Don't you remember reading in the Scriptures how Elijah complained to God about the people of Israel? </span> <span class="text Rom-11-3" id="en-CEV-26117"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup> He said, “Lord, they killed your prophets and destroyed your altars. I am the only one left, and now they want to kill me.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-11-4" id="en-CEV-26118"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup> But the Lord told Elijah, “I still have 7,000 followers who have not worshiped Baal.” </span> <span class="text Rom-11-5" id="en-CEV-26119"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>It is the same way now. God treated the people of Israel with undeserved grace, and so a few of them are still his followers. </span> <span class="text Rom-11-6" id="en-CEV-26120"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>This happened because of God's undeserved kindness and not because of anything they have done. It could not have happened except for God's gift of undeserved grace.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-11-7" id="en-CEV-26121"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>This means that only a chosen few of the people of Israel found what all of them were searching for. And the rest of them were stubborn, </span> <span class="text Rom-11-8" id="en-CEV-26122"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup> just as the Scriptures say,</span></p><div class="poetry"><p class="line"><span class="text Rom-11-8">“God made them so stupid</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Rom-11-8">that their eyes are blind,</span></span><br/><span class="text Rom-11-8">and their ears</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Rom-11-8">are still deaf.”</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1"><span class="text Rom-11-9" id="en-CEV-26123"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup> Then David said,</span></p><div class="poetry"><p class="line"><span class="text Rom-11-9">“Turn their meals</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Rom-11-9">into bait for a trap,</span></span><br/><span class="text Rom-11-9">so that they will stumble</span><br/><span class="text Rom-11-9">and be given</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Rom-11-9">what they deserve.</span></span><br/><span class="text Rom-11-10" id="en-CEV-26124"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Blindfold their eyes!</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Rom-11-10">Don't let them see.</span></span><br/><span class="text Rom-11-10">Bend their backs</span><br/><span class="text Rom-11-10">beneath a burden</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Rom-11-10">that will never be lifted.”</span></span></p></div> <h3><span class="text Rom-11-11" id="en-CEV-26125">Gentiles Will Be Saved</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-11-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Do I mean that the people of Israel fell, never to get up again? Certainly not! Their failure made it possible for the Gentiles to be saved, and this will make the people of Israel jealous. </span> <span class="text Rom-11-12" id="en-CEV-26126"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>But if the rest of the world's people were helped so much by their sin and loss, they will be helped even more by their full return.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-11-13" id="en-CEV-26127"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>I am now speaking to you Gentiles, and as long as I am an apostle to you, I will take pride in my work. </span> <span class="text Rom-11-14" id="en-CEV-26128"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>I hope in this way to make some of my own people jealous enough to be saved. </span> <span class="text Rom-11-15" id="en-CEV-26129"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>When Israel rejected God,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-26129a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-26129a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-26129a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> the rest of the people in the world were able to turn to him. So when God makes friends with Israel, it will be like bringing the dead back to life. </span> <span class="text Rom-11-16" id="en-CEV-26130"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>If part of a batch of dough is made holy by being offered to God, then all of the dough is holy. If the roots of a tree are holy, the rest of the tree is holy too.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-11-17" id="en-CEV-26131"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>You Gentiles are like branches of a wild olive tree made to be part of a cultivated olive tree. You have taken the place of some branches that were cut away from it. And because of this, you enjoy the blessings that come from being part of that cultivated tree. </span> <span class="text Rom-11-18" id="en-CEV-26132"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>But don't think you are better than the branches that were cut away. Just remember you are not supporting the roots of this tree. Its roots are supporting you.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-11-19" id="en-CEV-26133"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Maybe you think those branches were cut away, so you could be put in their place. </span> <span class="text Rom-11-20" id="en-CEV-26134"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>That's true enough. But they were cut away because they did not have faith, and you are where you are because you do have faith. So don't be proud, but be afraid. </span> <span class="text Rom-11-21" id="en-CEV-26135"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>If God cut away those natural branches, couldn't he do the same to you?</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-11-22" id="en-CEV-26136"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Now you see both how kind and how hard God can be. He was hard on those who fell, but he was kind to you. And he will keep on being kind to you, if you keep on trusting in his kindness. Otherwise, you will be cut away too.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-11-23" id="en-CEV-26137"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>If those other branches will start having faith, they will be made a part of that tree again. God has the power to put them back. </span> <span class="text Rom-11-24" id="en-CEV-26138"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>After all, it wasn't natural for branches to be cut from a wild olive tree and to be made part of a cultivated olive tree. So it is much more likely that God will join the natural branches back to the cultivated olive tree.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Rom-11-25" id="en-CEV-26139">The People of Israel Will Be Brought Back</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-11-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>My friends, I don't want you Gentiles to be too proud of yourselves. So I will explain the mystery of what has happened to the people of Israel. Some of them have become stubborn, and they will stay like that until the complete number of you Gentiles has come in. </span> <span class="text Rom-11-26" id="en-CEV-26140"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup> In this way all of Israel will be saved, as the Scriptures say,</span></p><div class="poetry"><p class="line"><span class="text Rom-11-26">“From Zion someone will come</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Rom-11-26">to rescue us.</span></span><br/><span class="text Rom-11-26">Then Jacob's descendants</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Rom-11-26">will stop being evil.</span></span><br/><span class="text Rom-11-27" id="en-CEV-26141"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup> This is what the Lord</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Rom-11-27">has promised to do</span></span><br/><span class="text Rom-11-27">when he forgives their sins.”</span></p></div> <p class="top-1"><span class="text Rom-11-28" id="en-CEV-26142"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>The people of Israel are treated as God's enemies, so the good news can come to you Gentiles.
