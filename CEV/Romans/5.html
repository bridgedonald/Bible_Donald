<h3><span class="text Rom-5-1" id="en-CEV-25956">What It Means To Be Acceptable to God</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Rom-5-1"><span class="chapternum">5 </span>By faith we have been made acceptable to God. And now, thanks to our Lord Jesus Christ, we have peace<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-25956a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-25956a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-25956a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> with God. </span> <span class="text Rom-5-2" id="en-CEV-25957"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Christ has also introduced us<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-25957b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-25957b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-25957b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> to God's gift of undeserved grace on which we now take our stand. So we are happy, as we look forward to sharing in the glory of God. </span> <span class="text Rom-5-3" id="en-CEV-25958"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>But that's not all! We gladly suffer,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-25958c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-25958c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-25958c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> because we know that suffering helps us to endure. </span> <span class="text Rom-5-4" id="en-CEV-25959"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>And endurance builds character, which gives us a hope </span> <span class="text Rom-5-5" id="en-CEV-25960"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>that will never disappoint us. All of this happens because God has given us the Holy Spirit, who fills our hearts with his love.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-5-6" id="en-CEV-25961"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Christ died for us at a time when we were helpless and sinful. </span> <span class="text Rom-5-7" id="en-CEV-25962"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>No one is really willing to die for an honest person, though someone might be willing to die for a truly good person. </span> <span class="text Rom-5-8" id="en-CEV-25963"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>But God showed how much he loved us by having Christ die for us, even though we were sinful.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-5-9" id="en-CEV-25964"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>But there is more! Now that God has accepted us because Christ sacrificed his life's blood, we will also be kept safe from God's anger. </span> <span class="text Rom-5-10" id="en-CEV-25965"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Even when we were God's enemies, he made peace with us, because his Son died for us. Yet something even greater than friendship is ours. Now that we are at peace with God, we will be saved by the life of his Son. </span> <span class="text Rom-5-11" id="en-CEV-25966"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>And in addition to everything else, we are happy because God sent our Lord Jesus Christ to make peace with us.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Rom-5-12" id="en-CEV-25967">Adam and Christ</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-5-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup> Adam sinned, and that sin brought death into the world. Now everyone has sinned, and so everyone must die. </span> <span class="text Rom-5-13" id="en-CEV-25968"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Sin was in the world before the Law came. But no record of sin was kept, because there was no Law. </span> <span class="text Rom-5-14" id="en-CEV-25969"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Yet death still had power over all who lived from the time of Adam to the time of Moses. This happened, though not everyone disobeyed a direct command from God, as Adam did.</span></p><p><span class="text Rom-5-14">In some ways Adam is like Christ who came later. </span> <span class="text Rom-5-15" id="en-CEV-25970"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>But the gift of God's undeserved grace was very different from Adam's sin. That one sin brought death to many others. Yet in an even greater way, Jesus Christ alone brought God's gift of undeserved grace to many people.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-5-16" id="en-CEV-25971"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>There is a lot of difference between Adam's sin and God's gift. That one sin led to punishment. But God's gift made it possible for us to be acceptable to him, even though we have sinned many times. </span> <span class="text Rom-5-17" id="en-CEV-25972"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Death ruled like a king because Adam had sinned. But that cannot compare with what Jesus Christ has done. God has treated us with undeserved grace, and he has accepted us because of Jesus. And so we will live and rule like kings.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-5-18" id="en-CEV-25973"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup> Everyone was going to be punished because Adam sinned. But because of the good thing that Christ has done, God accepts us and gives us the gift of life. </span> <span class="text Rom-5-19" id="en-CEV-25974"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Adam disobeyed God and caused many others to be sinners. But Jesus obeyed him and will make many people acceptable to God.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-5-20" id="en-CEV-25975"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>The Law came, so that the full power of sin could be seen. Yet where sin was powerful, God's gift of undeserved grace was even more powerful. </span> <span class="text Rom-5-21" id="en-CEV-25976"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Sin ruled by means of death. But God's gift of grace now rules, and God has accepted us because of Jesus Christ our Lord. This means that we will have eternal life.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
