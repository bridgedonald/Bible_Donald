Then you will know how to do everything that is good and pleasing to him.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-12-3" id="en-CEV-26153"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>I realize God has treated me with undeserved grace, and so I tell each of you not to think you are better than you really are. Use good sense and measure yourself by the amount of faith that God has given you. </span> <span class="text Rom-12-4" id="en-CEV-26154"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup> A body is made up of many parts, and each of them has its own use. </span> <span class="text Rom-12-5" id="en-CEV-26155"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>That's how it is with us. There are many of us, but we each are part of the body of Christ, as well as part of one another.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-12-6" id="en-CEV-26156"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup> God has also given each of us different gifts to use. If we can prophesy, we should do it according to the amount of faith we have. </span> <span class="text Rom-12-7" id="en-CEV-26157"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>If we can serve others, we should serve. If we can teach, we should teach. </span> <span class="text Rom-12-8" id="en-CEV-26158"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>If we can encourage others, we should encourage them. If we can give, we should be generous. If we are leaders, we should do our best. If we are good to others, we should do it cheerfully.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Rom-12-9" id="en-CEV-26159">Rules for Christian Living</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-12-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Be sincere in your love for others.
