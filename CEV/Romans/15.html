<h3><span class="text Rom-15-1" id="en-CEV-26209">Please Others and Not Yourself</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Rom-15-1"><span class="chapternum">15 </span>If our faith is strong, we should be patient with the Lord's followers whose faith is weak. We should try to please them instead of ourselves. </span> <span class="text Rom-15-2" id="en-CEV-26210"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>We should think of their good and try to help them by doing what pleases them. </span> <span class="text Rom-15-3" id="en-CEV-26211"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup> Even Christ did not try to please himself. But as the Scriptures say, “The people who insulted you also insulted me.” </span> <span class="text Rom-15-4" id="en-CEV-26212"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup> And the Scriptures were written to teach and encourage us by giving us hope. </span> <span class="text Rom-15-5" id="en-CEV-26213"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>God is the one who makes us patient and cheerful. I pray that he will help you live at peace with each other, as you follow Christ. </span> <span class="text Rom-15-6" id="en-CEV-26214"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Then all of you together will praise God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Rom-15-7" id="en-CEV-26215">The Good News Is for Jews and Gentiles</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-15-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Honor God by accepting each other, as Christ has accepted you. </span> <span class="text Rom-15-8" id="en-CEV-26216"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>I tell you that Christ came as a servant of the Jews to show that God has kept the promises he made to their famous ancestors. Christ also came, </span> <span class="text Rom-15-9" id="en-CEV-26217"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup> so that the Gentiles would praise God for being kind to them. It is just as the Scriptures say,</span></p><div class="poetry"><p class="line"><span class="text Rom-15-9">“I will tell the nations</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Rom-15-9">about you,</span></span><br/><span class="text Rom-15-9">and I will sing praises</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Rom-15-9">to your name.”</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1"><span class="text Rom-15-10" id="en-CEV-26218"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup> The Scriptures also say to the Gentiles, “Come and celebrate with God's people.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-15-11" id="en-CEV-26219"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup> Again the Scriptures say,</span></p><div class="poetry"><p class="line"><span class="text Rom-15-11">“Praise the Lord,</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Rom-15-11">all you Gentiles.</span></span><br/><span class="text Rom-15-11">All you nations, come</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Rom-15-11">and worship him.”</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1"><span class="text Rom-15-12" id="en-CEV-26220"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup> Isaiah says,</span></p><div class="poetry"><p class="line"><span class="text Rom-15-12">“Someone from David's family</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Rom-15-12">will come to power.</span></span><br/><span class="text Rom-15-12">He will rule the nations,</span><br/><span class="text Rom-15-12">and they will put their hope</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Rom-15-12">in him.”</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1"><span class="text Rom-15-13" id="en-CEV-26221"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>I pray that God, who gives hope, will bless you with complete happiness and peace because of your faith.

God treated me with undeserved grace! </span> <span class="text Rom-15-16" id="en-CEV-26224"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>He chose me to be a servant of Christ Jesus for the Gentiles and to do the work of a priest in the service of his good news. God did this so that the Holy Spirit could make the Gentiles into a holy offering, pleasing to him.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-15-17" id="en-CEV-26225"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Because of Christ Jesus, I can take pride in my service for God. </span> <span class="text Rom-15-18" id="en-CEV-26226"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>In fact, all I will talk about is how Christ let me speak and work, so that the Gentiles would obey him. </span> <span class="text Rom-15-19" id="en-CEV-26227"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Indeed, I will tell how Christ worked miracles and wonders by the power of the Holy Spirit. I have preached the good news about him all the way from Jerusalem to Illyricum. </span> <span class="text Rom-15-20" id="en-CEV-26228"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>But I have always tried to preach where people have never heard about Christ. I am like a builder who doesn't build on someone else's foundation. </span> <span class="text Rom-15-21" id="en-CEV-26229"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup> It is just as the Scriptures say,</span></p><div class="poetry"><p class="line"><span class="text Rom-15-21">“All who haven't been told</span><br/><span class="text Rom-15-21">about him</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Rom-15-21">will see him,</span></span><br/><span class="text Rom-15-21">and those who haven't heard</span><br/><span class="text Rom-15-21">about him</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Rom-15-21">will understand.”</span></span></p></div> <h3><span class="text Rom-15-22" id="en-CEV-26230">Paul's Plan To Visit Rome</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-15-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup> My work has always kept me from coming to see you. </span> <span class="text Rom-15-23" id="en-CEV-26231"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>Now there is nothing left for me to do in this part of the world, and for years I have wanted to visit you. </span> <span class="text Rom-15-24" id="en-CEV-26232"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>So I plan to stop off on my way to Spain.

But sharing their money with the Jews was also like paying back a debt, because the Jews had already shared their spiritual blessings with the Gentiles. </span> <span class="text Rom-15-28" id="en-CEV-26235"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>After I have safely delivered this money, I will visit you and then go on to Spain. </span> <span class="text Rom-15-29" id="en-CEV-26236"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>And when I do arrive in Rome, I know it will be with the full blessings of Christ.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-15-30" id="en-CEV-26237"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>My friends, by the power of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the love that comes from the Holy Spirit, I beg you to pray sincerely with me and for me. </span> <span class="text Rom-15-31" id="en-CEV-26238"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>Pray that God will protect me from the unbelievers in Judea, and that his people in Jerusalem will be pleased with what I am doing. </span> <span class="text Rom-15-32" id="en-CEV-26239"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>Ask God to let me come to you and have a pleasant and refreshing visit. </span> <span class="text Rom-15-33" id="en-CEV-26240"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>I pray that God, who gives peace, will be with all of you.
