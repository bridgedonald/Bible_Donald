<h3><span class="text Rom-6-1" id="en-CEV-25977">Dead to Sin but Alive because of Christ</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Rom-6-1"><span class="chapternum">6 </span>What should we say? Should we keep on sinning, so that God's gift of undeserved grace will show up even better? </span> <span class="text Rom-6-2" id="en-CEV-25978"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>No, we should not! If we are dead to sin, how can we go on sinning? </span> <span class="text Rom-6-3" id="en-CEV-25979"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Don't you know that all who share in Christ Jesus by being baptized also share in his death? </span> <span class="text Rom-6-4" id="en-CEV-25980"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup> When we were baptized, we died and were buried with Christ. We were baptized, so we would live a new life, as Christ was raised to life by the glory of God the Father.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-6-5" id="en-CEV-25981"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>If we shared in Jesus' death by being baptized, we will be raised to life with him. </span> <span class="text Rom-6-6" id="en-CEV-25982"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>We know that the persons we used to be were nailed to the cross with Jesus. This was done, so our sinful bodies would no longer be the slaves of sin. </span> <span class="text Rom-6-7" id="en-CEV-25983"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>We know sin doesn't have power over dead people.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-6-8" id="en-CEV-25984"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>As surely as we died with Christ, we believe we will also live with him. </span> <span class="text Rom-6-9" id="en-CEV-25985"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>We know that death no longer has any power over Christ. He died and was raised to life, never again to die. </span> <span class="text Rom-6-10" id="en-CEV-25986"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>When Christ died, he died for sin once and for all. But now he is alive, and he lives only for God. </span> <span class="text Rom-6-11" id="en-CEV-25987"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>In the same way, you must think of yourselves as dead to the power of sin. But Christ Jesus has given life to you, and you live for God.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-6-12" id="en-CEV-25988"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Don't let sin rule your body. After all, your body is bound to die, so don't obey its desires </span> <span class="text Rom-6-13" id="en-CEV-25989"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>or let any part of it become a slave of evil. Give yourselves to God, as people who have been raised from death to life. Make every part of your body a slave that pleases God. </span> <span class="text Rom-6-14" id="en-CEV-25990"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Don't let sin keep ruling your lives. You are ruled by God's undeserved grace and not by the Law.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Rom-6-15" id="en-CEV-25991">Slaves Who Do What Pleases God</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-6-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>What does all this mean? Does it mean we are free to sin, because we are ruled by God's gift of undeserved grace and not by the Law? Certainly not! </span> <span class="text Rom-6-16" id="en-CEV-25992"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Don't you know that you are slaves of anyone you obey? You can be slaves of sin and die, or you can be obedient slaves of God and be acceptable to him. </span> <span class="text Rom-6-17" id="en-CEV-25993"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>You used to be slaves of sin. But I thank God that with all your heart you followed the example set forth in the teaching you received. </span> <span class="text Rom-6-18" id="en-CEV-25994"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Now you are set free from sin and are slaves who please God.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-6-19" id="en-CEV-25995"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>I am using these everyday examples, because in some ways you are still weak. You used to let the different parts of your body be slaves of your evil thoughts. But now you must make every part of your body serve God, so that you will belong completely to him.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-6-20" id="en-CEV-25996"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>When you were slaves of sin, you didn't have to please God. </span> <span class="text Rom-6-21" id="en-CEV-25997"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>But what good did you receive from the things you did? All you have to show for them is your shame, and they lead to death. </span> <span class="text Rom-6-22" id="en-CEV-25998"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Now you have been set free from sin, and you are God's slaves. This will make you holy and will lead you to eternal life. </span> <span class="text Rom-6-23" id="en-CEV-25999"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>Sin pays off with death. But God's gift is eternal life given by Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></p>  <!--end of crossrefs-->
