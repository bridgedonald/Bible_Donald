<p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Rom-10-1" id="en-CEV-26094"><span class="chapternum">10 </span>Dear friends, my greatest wish and my prayer to God is for the people of Israel to be saved. </span> <span class="text Rom-10-2" id="en-CEV-26095"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>I know they love God, but they don't understand </span> <span class="text Rom-10-3" id="en-CEV-26096"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>what makes people acceptable to him. So they refuse to trust God, and they try to be acceptable by obeying the Law. </span> <span class="text Rom-10-4" id="en-CEV-26097"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>But Christ makes the Law no longer necessary<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-26097a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-26097a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-26097a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> for those who become acceptable to God by faith.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Rom-10-5" id="en-CEV-26098">Anyone Can Be Saved</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-10-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup> Moses said a person could become acceptable to God by obeying the Law. He did this when he wrote, “If you want to live, you must do all the Law commands.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-10-6" id="en-CEV-26099"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup> But people whose faith makes them acceptable to God will never ask, “Who will go up to heaven to bring Christ down?” </span> <span class="text Rom-10-7" id="en-CEV-26100"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Neither will they ask, “Who will go down into the world of the dead to raise him to life?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-10-8" id="en-CEV-26101"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>All who are acceptable because of their faith simply say, “The message is as near as your mouth or your heart.” And this is the same message we preach about faith. </span> <span class="text Rom-10-9" id="en-CEV-26102"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>So you will be saved, if you honestly say, “Jesus is Lord,” and if you believe with all your heart that God raised him from death. </span> <span class="text Rom-10-10" id="en-CEV-26103"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>God will accept you and save you, if you truly believe this and tell it to others.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-10-11" id="en-CEV-26104"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup> The Scriptures say no one who has faith will be disappointed, </span> <span class="text Rom-10-12" id="en-CEV-26105"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>no matter if that person is a Jew or a Gentile. There is only one Lord, and he is generous to everyone who asks for his help. </span> <span class="text Rom-10-13" id="en-CEV-26106"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup> All who call out to the Lord will be saved.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-10-14" id="en-CEV-26107"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>How can people have faith in the Lord and ask him to save them, if they have never heard about him? And how can they hear, unless someone tells them? </span> <span class="text Rom-10-15" id="en-CEV-26108"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup> And how can anyone tell them without being sent by the Lord? The Scriptures say it is a beautiful sight to see even the feet of someone coming to preach the good news. </span> <span class="text Rom-10-16" id="en-CEV-26109"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup> Yet not everyone has believed the message. For example, the prophet Isaiah asked, “Lord, has anyone believed what we said?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-10-17" id="en-CEV-26110"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>No one can have faith without hearing the message about Christ. </span> <span class="text Rom-10-18" id="en-CEV-26111"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup> But am I saying that the people of Israel did not hear?
