But God set you free when he sent his own Son to be like us sinners and to be a sacrifice for our sin. God used Christ's body to condemn sin. </span> <span class="text Rom-8-4" id="en-CEV-26028"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>He did this, so that we would do what the Law commands by obeying the Spirit instead of our own desires.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-8-5" id="en-CEV-26029"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>People who are ruled by their desires think only of themselves. Everyone who is ruled by the Holy Spirit thinks about spiritual things. </span> <span class="text Rom-8-6" id="en-CEV-26030"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>If our minds are ruled by our desires, we will die. But if our minds are ruled by the Spirit, we will have life and peace. </span> <span class="text Rom-8-7" id="en-CEV-26031"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Our desires fight against God, because they do not and cannot obey God's laws. </span> <span class="text Rom-8-8" id="en-CEV-26032"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>If we follow our desires, we cannot please God.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-8-9" id="en-CEV-26033"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>You are no longer ruled by your desires, but by God's Spirit, who lives in you. People who don't have the Spirit of Christ in them don't belong to him. </span> <span class="text Rom-8-10" id="en-CEV-26034"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>But Christ lives in you. So you are alive because God has accepted you, even though your bodies must die because of your sins. </span> <span class="text Rom-8-11" id="en-CEV-26035"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup> Yet God raised Jesus to life! God's Spirit now lives in you, and he will raise you to life by his Spirit.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-8-12" id="en-CEV-26036"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>My dear friends, we must not live to satisfy our desires. </span> <span class="text Rom-8-13" id="en-CEV-26037"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>If you do, you will die. But you will live, if by the help of God's Spirit you say “No” to your desires. </span> <span class="text Rom-8-14" id="en-CEV-26038"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Only those people who are led by God's Spirit are his children. </span> <span class="text Rom-8-15" id="en-CEV-26039"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup> God's Spirit doesn't make us slaves who are afraid of him. Instead, we become his children and call him our Father.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-26039b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-26039b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-26039b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Rom-8-16" id="en-CEV-26040"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>God's Spirit makes us sure that we are his children. </span> <span class="text Rom-8-17" id="en-CEV-26041"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>His Spirit lets us know that together with Christ we will be given what God has promised. We will also share in the glory of Christ, because we have suffered with him.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Rom-8-18" id="en-CEV-26042">A Wonderful Future for God's People</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-8-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup> I am sure what we are suffering now cannot compare with the glory that will be shown to us. </span> <span class="text Rom-8-19" id="en-CEV-26043"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>In fact, all creation is eagerly waiting for God to show who his children are. </span> <span class="text Rom-8-20" id="en-CEV-26044"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup> Meanwhile, creation is confused, but not because it wants to be confused. God made it this way in the hope </span> <span class="text Rom-8-21" id="en-CEV-26045"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>that creation would be set free from decay and would share in the glorious freedom of his children. </span> <span class="text Rom-8-22" id="en-CEV-26046"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>We know that all creation is still groaning and is in pain, like a woman about to give birth.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-8-23" id="en-CEV-26047"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup> The Spirit makes us sure about what we will be in the future. But now we groan silently, while we wait for God to show that we are his children.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-26047c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-26047c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-26047c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> This means that our bodies will also be set free. </span> <span class="text Rom-8-24" id="en-CEV-26048"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>And this hope is what saves us. But if we already have what we hope for, there is no need to keep on hoping. </span> <span class="text Rom-8-25" id="en-CEV-26049"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>However, we hope for something we have not yet seen, and we patiently wait for it.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-8-26" id="en-CEV-26050"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>In certain ways we are weak, but the Spirit is here to help us. For example, when we don't know what to pray for, the Spirit prays for us in ways that cannot be put into words. </span> <span class="text Rom-8-27" id="en-CEV-26051"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup> All of our thoughts are known to God. He can understand what is in the mind of the Spirit, as the Spirit prays for God's people. </span> <span class="text Rom-8-28" id="en-CEV-26052"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>We know that God is always at work for the good of everyone who loves him.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-26052d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-26052d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-26052d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> They are the ones God has chosen for his purpose, </span> <span class="text Rom-8-29" id="en-CEV-26053"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>and he has always known who his chosen ones would be. He had decided to let them become like his own Son, so his Son would be the first of many children. </span> <span class="text Rom-8-30" id="en-CEV-26054"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>God then accepted the people he had already decided to choose, and he has shared his glory with them.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Rom-8-31" id="en-CEV-26055">God's Love</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-8-31"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>What can we say about all this? If God is on our side, can anyone be against us? </span> <span class="text Rom-8-32" id="en-CEV-26056"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>God did not keep back his own Son, but he gave him for us.
