<h3><span class="text Rom-14-1" id="en-CEV-26186">Don't Criticize Others</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Rom-14-1"><span class="chapternum">14 </span> Welcome all the Lord's followers, even those whose faith is weak. Don't criticize them for having beliefs that are different from yours. </span> <span class="text Rom-14-2" id="en-CEV-26187"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Some think it is all right to eat anything, while those whose faith is weak will eat only vegetables. </span> <span class="text Rom-14-3" id="en-CEV-26188"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>But you should not criticize others for eating or for not eating. After all, God welcomes everyone. </span> <span class="text Rom-14-4" id="en-CEV-26189"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>What right do you have to criticize someone else's servants? Only their Lord can decide if they are doing right, and the Lord will make sure that they do right.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-14-5" id="en-CEV-26190"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Some of the Lord's followers think one day is more important than another. Others think all days are the same. But each of you should make up your own mind. </span> <span class="text Rom-14-6" id="en-CEV-26191"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Any followers who count one day more important than another day do it to honor their Lord. And any followers who eat meat give thanks to God, just like the ones who don't eat meat.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-14-7" id="en-CEV-26192"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Whether we live or die, it must be for God, rather than for ourselves. </span> <span class="text Rom-14-8" id="en-CEV-26193"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Whether we live or die, it must be for the Lord. Alive or dead, we still belong to the Lord. </span> <span class="text Rom-14-9" id="en-CEV-26194"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>This is because Christ died and rose to life, so that he would be the Lord of the dead and of the living. </span> <span class="text Rom-14-10" id="en-CEV-26195"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup> Why do you criticize other followers of the Lord? Why do you look down on them? The day is coming when God will judge all of us. </span> <span class="text Rom-14-11" id="en-CEV-26196"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup> In the Scriptures God says,</span></p><div class="poetry"><p class="line"><span class="text Rom-14-11">“I swear by my very life</span><br/><span class="text Rom-14-11">that everyone will kneel down</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Rom-14-11">and praise my name!”</span></span></p></div> <top1></top1> <p class="first-line-none"><span class="text Rom-14-12" id="en-CEV-26197"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>And so, each of us must give an account to God for what we do.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Rom-14-13" id="en-CEV-26198">Don't Cause Problems for Others</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-14-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>We must stop judging others. We must also make up our minds not to upset anyone's faith. </span> <span class="text Rom-14-14" id="en-CEV-26199"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>The Lord Jesus has made it clear to me that God considers all foods fit to eat. But if you think some foods are unfit to eat, then for you they are not fit.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-14-15" id="en-CEV-26200"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>If you are hurting others by the foods you eat, you are not guided by love. Don't let your appetite destroy someone Christ died for. </span> <span class="text Rom-14-16" id="en-CEV-26201"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Don't let your right to eat bring shame to Christ. </span> <span class="text Rom-14-17" id="en-CEV-26202"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>God's kingdom isn't about eating and drinking. It is about pleasing God, about living in peace, and about true happiness. All this comes from the Holy Spirit. </span> <span class="text Rom-14-18" id="en-CEV-26203"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>If you serve Christ in this way, you will please God and be respected by people. </span> <span class="text Rom-14-19" id="en-CEV-26204"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>We should try<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-26204a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-26204a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-26204a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> to live at peace and help each other have a strong faith.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rom-14-20" id="en-CEV-26205"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Don't let your appetite destroy what God has done. All foods are fit to eat, but it is wrong to cause problems for others by what you eat. </span> <span class="text Rom-14-21" id="en-CEV-26206"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>It is best not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything else that causes problems for other followers of the Lord. </span> <span class="text Rom-14-22" id="en-CEV-26207"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>What you believe about these things should be kept between you and God. You are fortunate, if your actions don't make you have doubts. </span> <span class="text Rom-14-23" id="en-CEV-26208"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>But if you do have doubts about what you eat, you are going against your beliefs. And you know that is wrong, because anything you do against your beliefs is sin.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
