Now, who else will show their dedication to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> by giving gifts for building his temple?</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Chr-29-6" id="en-CEV-9585"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>After David finished speaking, the family leaders, the tribal leaders, the army commanders, and the government officials voluntarily gave gifts </span> <span class="text 1Chr-29-7" id="en-CEV-9586"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>for the temple. These gifts included more than 170 tons of gold, over 340 tons of silver, 620 tons of bronze, and more than 3,400 tons of iron. </span> <span class="text 1Chr-29-8" id="en-CEV-9587"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Everyone who owned precious stones also donated them to the temple treasury, where Jehiel from the Levite clan of Gershon guarded them.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Chr-29-9" id="en-CEV-9588"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>David and the people were very happy that so much had been given to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, and they all celebrated.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 1Chr-29-10" id="en-CEV-9589">David Praises the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span></h3><p><span class="text 1Chr-29-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Then, in front of everyone, David sang praises to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Chr-29-10">I praise you forever, <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>!
