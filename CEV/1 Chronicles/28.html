I wanted to build a place where the sacred chest would be kept, so we could go there and worship the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> our God. I have prepared all the supplies for building a temple, </span> <span class="text 1Chr-28-3" id="en-CEV-9561"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>but the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has refused to let me build it, because he said I have killed too many people in battle.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Chr-28-4" id="en-CEV-9562"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God chose Judah to be the leading tribe in Israel. Then from Judah, he chose my father's family, and from that family, he chose me to be the king of Israel, and he promised that my descendants will also rule as kings. </span> <span class="text 1Chr-28-5" id="en-CEV-9563"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has blessed me with many sons, but he chose my son Solomon to be the next king of Israel. </span> <span class="text 1Chr-28-6" id="en-CEV-9564"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to me, “Your son Solomon will build my temple, and it will honor me. Solomon will be like a son to me, and I will be like a father to him. </span> <span class="text 1Chr-28-7" id="en-CEV-9565"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>If he continues to obey my laws and commands, his kingdom will never end.”</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Chr-28-8" id="en-CEV-9566"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>My friends, you are the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s people. And now, with God as your witness, I want you to promise that you will do your best to obey everything the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God has commanded us. Then this land will always belong to you and your descendants.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Chr-28-9" id="en-CEV-9567"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Solomon, my son, worship God and obey him with all your heart and mind, just as I have done. He knows all your thoughts and your reasons for doing things, and so if you turn to him, he will hear your prayers. But if you ignore him, he will reject you forever. </span> <span class="text 1Chr-28-10" id="en-CEV-9568"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has chosen you to build a temple for worshiping him.

Be confident, and never be afraid of anything or get discouraged. The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> my God will help you do everything needed to finish the temple, so it can be used for worshiping him. </span> <span class="text 1Chr-28-21" id="en-CEV-9579"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>The priests and Levites have been assigned their duties, and all the skilled workers are prepared to do their work. The people and their leaders will do anything you tell them.</span></p>  <!--end of crossrefs-->
