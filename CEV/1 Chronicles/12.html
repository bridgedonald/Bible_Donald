<h3><span class="text 1Chr-12-1" id="en-CEV-9215">David's Men at Ziklag</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text 1Chr-12-1"><span class="chapternum">12 </span>Some time earlier, David had gone to live in the town of Ziklag to escape from King Saul. While David was there, several brave warriors joined him to help fight his battles.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-9215a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-9215a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-9215a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></span></p> <h4><span class="text 1Chr-12-2" id="en-CEV-9216">Warriors from the Benjamin tribe</span></h4><p><span class="text 1Chr-12-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Several of these warriors were from King Saul's own tribe of Benjamin. They were experts at using a bow and arrows, and they could shoot an arrow or sling a stone with either hand. </span> <span class="text 1Chr-12-3-1Chr-12-7" id="en-CEV-9217"><sup class="versenum">3-7 </sup>Their leaders were Ahiezer and Joash, the sons of Shemaah from Gibeah. Here is a list of those men from Benjamin: Jeziel and Pelet the sons of Azmaveth; Beracah and Jehu from Anathoth; Ishmaiah from Gibeon, who was the leader of the Thirty Warriors; Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, and Jozabad from Gederah; Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, and Shephatiah from Haruph; Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam from the Korah clan; Joelah and Zebadiah the sons of Jeroham from Gedor.</span></p> <h4><span class="text 1Chr-12-8" id="en-CEV-9218">Warriors from the Gad tribe</span></h4><p><span class="text 1Chr-12-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Men from the tribe of Gad also joined David at his fortress in the desert and served as his warriors. They were also brave soldiers—fierce as lions and quick as gazelles. They were always prepared to fight with shields and spears. </span> <span class="text 1Chr-12-9-1Chr-12-13" id="en-CEV-9219"><sup class="versenum">9-13 </sup>There were eleven of them, ranked in the following order: Ezer the leader, then Obadiah, Eliab, Mishmannah, Jeremiah, Attai, Eliel, Johanan, Elzabad, Jeremiah, and Machbannai.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Chr-12-14" id="en-CEV-9220"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>All these men were army officers; some were high-ranking officers over a thousand troops, and others were officers over a hundred troops. </span> <span class="text 1Chr-12-15" id="en-CEV-9221"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Earlier, they had crossed the Jordan River when it flooded, and they chased out the people who lived in the valleys on each side of the river.</span></p> <h4><span class="text 1Chr-12-16" id="en-CEV-9222">Warriors from the Benjamin and Judah tribes</span></h4><p><span class="text 1Chr-12-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>One time a group of men from the tribes of Benjamin and Judah went to the fortress where David was staying. </span> <span class="text 1Chr-12-17" id="en-CEV-9223"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>David met them outside and said, “If you are coming as friends to fight on my side, then stay and join us. But if you try to turn me over to my enemies, the God our ancestors worshiped will punish you, because I have done nothing wrong.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Chr-12-18" id="en-CEV-9224"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Amasai, who later became the leader of the Thirty Warriors, was one of these men who went to David. God's Spirit took control of him, and he said, “We will join you, David son of Jesse! You and your followers will always be successful, because God fights on your side.”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Chr-12-18">So David agreed to let them stay, and he even put them in charge of his soldiers who raided enemy villages.</span></p> <h4><span class="text 1Chr-12-19" id="en-CEV-9225">Warriors from the Manasseh tribe</span></h4><p><span class="text 1Chr-12-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Some of the warriors who joined David were from the tribe of Manasseh. They had earlier gone with David when he agreed to fight on the side of the Philistines against King Saul. But as soon as the Philistine rulers realized that David might turn against them and rejoin Saul, they sent David away to the town of Ziklag. </span> <span class="text 1Chr-12-20" id="en-CEV-9226"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>That's when the following men from Manasseh joined him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai. They had all been commanders in Saul's army </span> <span class="text 1Chr-12-21" id="en-CEV-9227"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>and brave soldiers, and so David made them officers in his army. They fought on his side when enemy troops attacked.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Chr-12-22" id="en-CEV-9228"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Day after day, new men came to join David, and soon he had a large, powerful army.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 1Chr-12-23-1Chr-12-37" id="en-CEV-9229">David's Men at Hebron</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Chr-12-23-1Chr-12-37"><sup class="versenum">23-37 </sup>The kingdom of Israel had been taken away from Saul, and it now belonged to David. He was ruling from Hebron, and thousands of well-trained soldiers from each tribe went there to crown David king of all Israel, just as the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had promised. These soldiers, who were always prepared for battle, included: 6,800 from Judah, who were armed with shields and spears; 7,100 from Simeon; 4,600 from Levi, including Jehoiada, who was a leader from Aaron's descendants, and his 3,700 men, as well as Zadok, who was a brave soldier, and 22 of his relatives, who were also officers; 3,000 from Benjamin, because this was Saul's own tribe and most of the men had remained loyal to him; 20,800 from Ephraim, who were not only brave, but also famous in their clans; 18,000 from West Manasseh, who had been chosen to help make David king; 200 leaders from Issachar, along with troops under their command—these leaders knew the right time to do what needed to be done; 50,000 from Zebulun, who were not only loyal, but also trained to use any weapon; 1,000 officers from Naphtali and 37,000 soldiers armed with shields and spears; 28,600 from Dan; 40,000 from Asher; and 120,000 from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh, who were armed with all kinds of weapons.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Chr-12-38" id="en-CEV-9230"><sup class="versenum">38 </sup>All of these soldiers voluntarily came to Hebron because they wanted David to become king of Israel. In fact, everyone in Israel wanted the same thing. </span> <span class="text 1Chr-12-39" id="en-CEV-9231"><sup class="versenum">39 </sup>The soldiers stayed in Hebron three days, eating and drinking what their relatives had prepared for them. </span> <span class="text 1Chr-12-40" id="en-CEV-9232"><sup class="versenum">40 </sup>Other Israelites from as far away as the territories of Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali brought cattle and sheep to slaughter for food. They also brought donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen that were loaded down with flour, dried figs and raisins, wine, and olive oil.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Chr-12-40">Everyone in Israel was very happy.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
<h4>Footnotes</h4><ol><li id="fen-CEV-9215a"><a href="#en-CEV-9215" title="Go to 1 Chronicles 12:1">12.1</a> <span class="footnote-text"><i>David had gone … battles:</i> Ziklag was the Philistine town that King Achish of Gath gave David in return for his loyalty (see 1 Samuel 27.6). This happened during the time that David was living as an outlaw, so the events in this chapter actually took place before chapter 11 when David became king of Israel.</span></li>
