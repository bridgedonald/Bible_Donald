<h3><span class="text 2Kgs-6-1" id="en-CEV-8319">Elisha Makes an Ax Head Float</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text 2Kgs-6-1"><span class="chapternum">6 </span>One day the prophets said to Elisha, “The place where we meet with you is too small. </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-6-2" id="en-CEV-8320"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Why don't we build a new meeting place near the Jordan River? Each of us could get some wood, then we could build it.”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-6-2">“That's a good idea,” Elisha replied, “get started.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-6-3" id="en-CEV-8321"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>“Aren't you going with us?” one of the prophets asked.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-6-3">“Yes, I'll go,” Elisha answered, </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-6-4" id="en-CEV-8322"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>and he left with them.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-6-4">They went to the Jordan River and began chopping down trees. </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-6-5" id="en-CEV-8323"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>While one of the prophets was working, his ax head fell off and dropped into the water. “Oh!” he shouted. “Sir, I borrowed this ax.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-6-6" id="en-CEV-8324"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>“Where did it fall in?” Elisha asked. The prophet pointed to the place, and Elisha cut a stick and threw it into the water at that spot. The ax head floated to the top of the water.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-6-7" id="en-CEV-8325"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>“Now get it,” Elisha told him. And the prophet reached in and grabbed it.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 2Kgs-6-8" id="en-CEV-8326">Elisha Stops an Invasion of the Syrian Army</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-6-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Time after time, when the king of Syria was at war against the Israelites, he met with his officers and announced, “I've decided where we will set up camp.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-6-9" id="en-CEV-8327"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Each time, Elisha<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-8327a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-8327a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-8327a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> would send this warning to the king of Israel: “Don't go near there. That's where the Syrian troops have set up camp.”<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-8327b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-8327b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-8327b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-6-10" id="en-CEV-8328"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>So the king would warn the Israelite troops in that place to be on guard.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-6-11" id="en-CEV-8329"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>The king of Syria was furious when he found out what was happening. He called in his officers and asked, “Which one of you has been telling the king of Israel our plans?”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-6-12" id="en-CEV-8330"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>“None of us, Your Majesty,” one of them answered. “It's an Israelite named Elisha. He's a prophet, so he can tell his king everything—even what you say in your own room.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-6-13" id="en-CEV-8331"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>“Find out where he is!” the king ordered. “I'll send soldiers to bring him here.”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-6-13">They learned that Elisha was in the town of Dothan<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-8331c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-8331c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-8331c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> and reported it to the king. </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-6-14" id="en-CEV-8332"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>He ordered his best troops to go there with horses and chariots. They marched out during the night and surrounded the town.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-6-15" id="en-CEV-8333"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>When Elisha's servant got up the next morning, he saw that Syrian troops had the town surrounded. “Sir, what are we going to do?” he asked.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-6-16" id="en-CEV-8334"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>“Don't be afraid,” Elisha answered. “There are more troops on our side than on theirs.” </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-6-17" id="en-CEV-8335"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Then he prayed, “<span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, please help him to see.” And the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> let the servant see that the hill<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-8335d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-8335d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-8335d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> was covered with fiery horses and flaming chariots all around Elisha.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-6-18" id="en-CEV-8336"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>As the Syrian army came closer, Elisha prayed, “<span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, make those soldiers blind!” And the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> blinded them with a bright light.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-6-19" id="en-CEV-8337"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Elisha told the enemy troops, “You've taken the wrong road and are in the wrong town. Follow me. I'll lead you to the man you're looking for.” Elisha led them straight to the capital city of Samaria.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-6-20" id="en-CEV-8338"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>When all the soldiers were inside the city, Elisha prayed, “<span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, now let them see again.” The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> let them see that they were standing in the middle of Samaria.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-6-21" id="en-CEV-8339"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>The king of Israel saw them and asked Elisha, “Should I kill them, sir?”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-6-22" id="en-CEV-8340"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>“No!” Elisha answered. “You didn't capture these troops in battle, so you have no right to kill them. Instead, give them something to eat and drink and let them return to their leader.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-6-23" id="en-CEV-8341"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>The king ordered a huge meal to be prepared for Syria's army, and when they finished eating, he let them go.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-6-23">For a while, the Syrian troops stopped invading Israel's territory.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 2Kgs-6-24" id="en-CEV-8342">King Benhadad of Syria Attacks Samaria</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-6-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>Some time later, King Benhadad of Syria<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-8342e" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-8342e" title="See footnote e"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-8342e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> called his entire army together, then they marched to Samaria and attacked. </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-6-25" id="en-CEV-8343"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>They kept up the attack until there was nothing to eat in the city. In fact, a donkey's head cost 80 pieces of silver, and a small bowl of pigeon droppings<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-8343f" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-8343f" title="See footnote f"&gt;f&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-8343f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> cost 5 pieces of silver.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-6-26" id="en-CEV-8344"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>One day as the king of Israel<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-8344g" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-8344g" title="See footnote g"&gt;g&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-8344g" title="See footnote g">g</a>]</sup> was walking along the top of the city wall, a woman shouted to him, “Please, Your Majesty, help me!”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-6-27" id="en-CEV-8345"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>“Let the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> help you!” the king said. “Do you think I have grain or wine to give you?” </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-6-28" id="en-CEV-8346"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>Then he asked, “What's the matter anyway?”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-6-28">The woman answered, “Another woman and I were so hungry that we agreed to eat our sons.

When you see him coming, shut the door and don't let him in.
