But seven days later, there was no drinking water left for them or their animals. </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-3-10" id="en-CEV-8231"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Joram cried out, “This is terrible! The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> must have led us out here to be captured by Moab's army.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-3-11" id="en-CEV-8232"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Jehoshaphat said, “Which of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s prophets is with us?

Israel's army chased them all the way back to Moab, and even there they kept up the attack.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-8245f" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-8245f" title="See footnote f"&gt;f&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-8245f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-3-25" id="en-CEV-8246"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>The Israelites destroyed the Moabite towns.
