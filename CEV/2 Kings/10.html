<h3><span class="text 2Kgs-10-1" id="en-CEV-8432">Jehu Kills All of Ahab's Descendants</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text 2Kgs-10-1"><span class="chapternum">10 </span>Ahab still had 70 descendants living in Samaria. So Jehu wrote a letter to each of the important leaders and officials of the town,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-8432a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-8432a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-8432a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> and to those who supported Ahab. In the letters he wrote:</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text 2Kgs-10-2" id="en-CEV-8433"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Your town is strong, and you're protected by chariots and an armed cavalry. And I know that King Ahab's descendants live there with you. So as soon as you read this letter, </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-10-3" id="en-CEV-8434"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>choose the best person for the job and make him the next king. Then be prepared to defend Ahab's family.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-10-4" id="en-CEV-8435"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>The officials and leaders read the letters and were very frightened. They said to each other, “Jehu has already killed King Joram and King Ahaziah! We have to do what he says.” </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-10-5" id="en-CEV-8436"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>The prime minister, the mayor of the city, as well as the other leaders and Ahab's supporters, sent this answer to Jehu, “We are your servants, Your Majesty, and we will do whatever you tell us. But it's not our place to choose someone to be king. You do what you think is best.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-10-6" id="en-CEV-8437"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Jehu then wrote another letter which said, “If you are on my side and will obey me, then prove it. Bring me the heads of the descendants of Ahab! And be here in Jezreel by this time tomorrow.”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-10-6">The 70 descendants of King Ahab were living with some of the most important people of the city. </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-10-7" id="en-CEV-8438"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>And when these people read Jehu's second letter, they called together all 70 of Ahab's descendants. They killed them, put their heads in baskets, and sent them to Jezreel.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-10-8" id="en-CEV-8439"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>When Jehu was told what had happened, he said, “Put the heads in two piles at the city gate, and leave them there until morning.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-10-9" id="en-CEV-8440"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>The next morning, Jehu went out and stood where everyone could hear him, and he said, “You people are not guilty of anything. I'm the one who plotted against Joram and had him killed. But who killed all these men? </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-10-10" id="en-CEV-8441"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Listen to me. Everything the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s servant Elijah promised about Ahab's family will come true.”<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-8441b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-8441b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-8441b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-10-11" id="en-CEV-8442"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup> Then Jehu killed the rest of Ahab's relatives living in Jezreel, as well as his highest officials, his priests, and his closest friends. No one in Ahab's family was left alive in Jezreel.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-10-12-2Kgs-10-13" id="en-CEV-8443"><sup class="versenum">12-13 </sup>Jehu left for Samaria, and along the way, he met some relatives of King Ahaziah of Judah at a place where shepherds meet.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-8443c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-8443c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-8443c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> He asked, “Who are you?”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-10-12-2Kgs-10-13">“We are relatives of Ahaziah,” they answered. “We're going to visit his family.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-10-14" id="en-CEV-8444"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>“Take them alive!” Jehu said to his officers. So they grabbed them and led them to the well near the shepherds' meeting place, where they killed all 42 of them.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-10-15" id="en-CEV-8445"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>As Jehu went on, he saw Jehonadab son of Rechab<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-8445d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-8445d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-8445d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> coming to meet him. Jehu greeted him, then said, “Jehonadab, I'm on your side. Are you on mine?”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-10-15">“Yes, I am.”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-10-15">“Then give me your hand,” Jehu answered. He helped Jehonadab into his chariot </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-10-16" id="en-CEV-8446"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>and said, “Come with me and see how faithful I am to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>.”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-10-16">They rode together in Jehu's chariot </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-10-17" id="en-CEV-8447"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>to Samaria. Jehu killed everyone there who belonged to Ahab's family, as well as all his officials. Everyone in his family was now dead, just as the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had promised Elijah.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 2Kgs-10-18" id="en-CEV-8448">Jehu Kills All the Worshipers of Baal</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-10-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Jehu called together the people in Samaria and said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 2Kgs-10-18">King Ahab sometimes worshiped Baal, but I will be completely faithful to Baal. </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-10-19" id="en-CEV-8449"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>I'm going to offer a huge sacrifice to him. So invite his prophets and priests, and be sure everyone who worships him is there. Anyone who doesn't come will be killed.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-10-19">But this was a trick—Jehu was really planning to kill the worshipers of Baal. </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-10-20" id="en-CEV-8450"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>He said, “Announce a day of worship for Baal!” After the day had been announced, </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-10-21" id="en-CEV-8451"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Jehu sent an invitation to everyone in Israel. All the worshipers of Baal came, and the temple was filled from one end to the other. </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-10-22" id="en-CEV-8452"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Jehu told the official in charge of the sacred robes to make sure that everyone had a robe to wear.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-10-23" id="en-CEV-8453"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>Jehu and Jehonadab went into the temple, and Jehu said to the crowd, “Look around and make sure that only the worshipers of Baal are here. No one who worships the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> is allowed in.” </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-10-24" id="en-CEV-8454"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>Then they began to offer sacrifices to Baal.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-10-24">Earlier, Jehu had ordered 80 soldiers to wait outside the temple. He had warned them, “I will get all these worshipers here, and if any of you let even one of them escape, you will be killed instead!”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-10-25" id="en-CEV-8455"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>As soon as Jehu finished offering the sacrifice, he told the guards and soldiers, “Come in and kill them! Don't let anyone escape.” They slaughtered everyone in the crowd and threw the bodies outside. Then they went back into the temple </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-10-26" id="en-CEV-8456"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>and carried out the image of Baal. They burned it </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-10-27" id="en-CEV-8457"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>and broke it into pieces, then they completely destroyed Baal's temple. And since that time, it's been nothing but a public toilet.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-8457e" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-8457e" title="See footnote e"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-8457e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-10-28" id="en-CEV-8458"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>That's how Jehu stopped the worship of Baal in Israel. </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-10-29" id="en-CEV-8459"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup> But he did not stop the worship of the gold statues of calves at Dan and Bethel that Jeroboam had made for the people to worship.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-8459f" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-8459f" title="See footnote f"&gt;f&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-8459f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-10-30" id="en-CEV-8460"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>Later the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said, “Jehu, you have done right by destroying Ahab's entire family, just as I had planned. So I will make sure that the next four kings of Israel will come from your own family.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-10-31" id="en-CEV-8461"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>But Jehu did not completely obey the commands of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God of Israel. Instead, he kept doing the sinful things that Jeroboam had caused the Israelites to do.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 2Kgs-10-32" id="en-CEV-8462">Jehu Dies</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-10-32"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>In those days the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> began to reduce the size of Israel's territory. King Hazael of Syria defeated the Israelites and took control </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-10-33" id="en-CEV-8463"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>of the regions of Gilead and Bashan east of the Jordan River and north of the town of Aroer near the Arnon River.
