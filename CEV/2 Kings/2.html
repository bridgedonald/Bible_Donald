<h3><span class="text 2Kgs-2-1" id="en-CEV-8197">The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> Takes Elijah Away</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text 2Kgs-2-1"><span class="chapternum">2 </span>Not long before the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> took Elijah up into heaven in a strong wind, Elijah and Elisha were leaving Gilgal. </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-2-2" id="en-CEV-8198"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Elijah said to Elisha, “The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> wants me to go to Bethel, but you must stay here.”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-2">Elisha replied, “I swear by the living <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> and by your own life that I will stay with you no matter what!” And he went with Elijah to Bethel.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-3" id="en-CEV-8199"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>A group of prophets who lived there asked Elisha, “Do you know that today the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> is going to take away your master?”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-3">“Yes, I do,” Elisha answered. “But don't remind me of it.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-4" id="en-CEV-8200"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Elijah then said, “Elisha, now the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> wants me to go to Jericho, but you must stay here.”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-4">Elisha replied, “I swear by the living <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> and by your own life, that I will stay with you no matter what!” And he went with Elijah to Jericho.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-5" id="en-CEV-8201"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>A group of prophets who lived there asked Elisha, “Do you know that today the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> is going to take away your master?”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-5">“Yes, I do,” Elisha answered. “But don't remind me of it.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-6" id="en-CEV-8202"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Elijah then said to Elisha, “Now the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> wants me to go to the Jordan River, but you must stay here.”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-6">Elisha replied, “I swear by the living <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> and by your own life that I will never leave you!” So the two of them walked on together.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-7" id="en-CEV-8203"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Fifty prophets followed Elijah and Elisha from Jericho, then stood at a distance and watched as the two men walked toward the river. </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-2-8" id="en-CEV-8204"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>When they got there, Elijah took off his coat, then he rolled it up and struck the water with it. At once a path opened up through the river, and the two of them walked across on dry ground.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-9" id="en-CEV-8205"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup> After they had reached the other side, Elijah said, “Elisha, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will soon take me away. What can I do for you before that happens?”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-9">Elisha answered, “Please give me twice as much of your power as you give the other prophets, so I can be the one who takes your place as their leader.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-10" id="en-CEV-8206"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>“It won't be easy,” Elijah answered. “It can happen only if you see me as I am being taken away.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-11" id="en-CEV-8207"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Elijah and Elisha were walking along and talking, when suddenly there appeared between them a flaming chariot pulled by fiery horses. At once, a strong wind took Elijah up into heaven. </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-2-12" id="en-CEV-8208"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup> Elisha saw this and shouted, “Israel's cavalry and chariots have taken my master away!”<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-8208a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-8208a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-8208a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> After Elijah had gone, Elisha tore his clothes in sorrow.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-13" id="en-CEV-8209"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Elijah's coat had fallen off, so Elisha picked it up and walked back to the Jordan River. </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-2-14" id="en-CEV-8210"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>He struck the water with the coat and wondered, “Will the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> perform miracles for me as he did for Elijah?” As soon as Elisha did this, a dry path opened up through the water, and he walked across.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-15" id="en-CEV-8211"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>When the prophets from Jericho saw what happened, they said to each other, “Elisha now has Elijah's power.”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-15">They walked over to him, bowed down, </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-2-16" id="en-CEV-8212"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>and said, “There are 50 strong men here with us. Please let them go look for your master. Maybe the Spirit of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> carried him off to some mountain or valley.”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-16">“No,” Elisha replied, “they won't find him.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-17" id="en-CEV-8213"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>They kept begging until he was embarrassed to say no. He finally agreed, and the prophets sent the men out. They looked three days for Elijah but never found him. </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-2-18" id="en-CEV-8214"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>They returned to Jericho, and Elisha said, “I told you that you wouldn't find him.”</span></p> <h3><span class="text 2Kgs-2-19" id="en-CEV-8215">Elisha Makes the Water Pure at Jericho</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>One day the people of Jericho said, “Elisha, you can see that our city is in a good spot. But the water from our spring is so bad that it even keeps our crops from growing.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-20" id="en-CEV-8216"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>He replied, “Put some salt in a new bowl and bring it to me.”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-20">They brought him the bowl of salt, </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-2-21" id="en-CEV-8217"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>and he carried it to the spring. He threw the salt into the water and said, “The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has made this water pure again. From now on you'll be able to grow crops, and no one will starve.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-22" id="en-CEV-8218"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>The water has been fine ever since, just as Elisha said.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 2Kgs-2-23" id="en-CEV-8219">Some Boys Make Fun of Elisha</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>Elisha left and headed toward Bethel. Along the way some boys started making fun of him by shouting, “Go away, baldy! Get out of here!”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-24" id="en-CEV-8220"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>Elisha turned around and stared at the boys. Then he cursed them in the name of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>. At once two bears ran out of the woods and ripped to pieces 42 of the boys.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-25" id="en-CEV-8221"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Elisha went up to Mount Carmel, then returned to Samaria.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
