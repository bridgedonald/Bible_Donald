Take him to a place where the two of you can be alone, </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-9-3" id="en-CEV-8400"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>then pour olive oil on his head to show that he is the new king. Say to him, “The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has chosen you to be king of Israel.” Then leave quickly—don't wait around for anything!</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-9-4" id="en-CEV-8401"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>The young prophet left for Ramoth. </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-9-5" id="en-CEV-8402"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>When he arrived, the army officers were meeting together. “Sir, I have a message for you,” he said.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-9-5">“For which one of us?” Jehu asked.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-9-5">“You, sir,” the prophet answered. </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-9-6" id="en-CEV-8403"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup> So Jehu got up and went inside.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-8403a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-8403a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-8403a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> The prophet poured olive oil on Jehu's head and told him:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 2Kgs-9-6">The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God of Israel has this message for you: “I am the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, and I have chosen you to be king of my people Israel. </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-9-7" id="en-CEV-8404"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>I want you to wipe out the family of Ahab, so Jezebel will be punished for killing the prophets and my other servants. </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-9-8" id="en-CEV-8405"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Every man and boy in Ahab's family must die, whether slave or free. </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-9-9" id="en-CEV-8406"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>His whole family must be destroyed, just like the families of Jeroboam son of Nebat and Baasha son of Ahijah. </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-9-10" id="en-CEV-8407"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup> As for Jezebel, her body will be eaten by dogs in the town of Jezreel. There won't be enough left of her to bury.”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-9-10">Then the young prophet opened the door and ran out.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-9-11" id="en-CEV-8408"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Jehu went back to his officers, and one of them asked, “What did that crazy prophet want? Is everything all right?”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-9-11">“You know him and how he talks,” Jehu answered.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-9-12" id="en-CEV-8409"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>“No, we don't. What did he say?” they asked.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-9-12">“He had a message from the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>,” Jehu replied. “He said that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has chosen me to be the next king of Israel.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-9-13" id="en-CEV-8410"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>They quickly grabbed their coats and spread them out on the steps where Jehu was standing.

Joram was now recovering in Jezreel, and King Ahaziah of Judah was there, visiting him.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-9-14-2Kgs-9-16">Meanwhile, Jehu was in Ramoth, making plans to kill Joram. He said to his officers, “If you want me to be king, then don't let anyone leave this town. They might go to Jezreel and tell Joram.” Then Jehu got in his chariot and rode to Jezreel.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-9-17" id="en-CEV-8412"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>When the guard in the watchtower at Jezreel saw Jehu and his men riding up, he shouted to the king, “I see a large group of men coming this way.”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-9-17">Joram ordered, “Send someone out to ask them if this is a friendly visit.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-9-18" id="en-CEV-8413"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>One of the soldiers rode out and said to Jehu, “King Joram wants to know if this is a friendly visit.”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-9-18">“What's it to you?” Jehu asked. “Just stay behind me with the rest of my troops!”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-9-18">About the same time the guard in the watchtower said, “Your Majesty, the rider got there, but he isn't coming back.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-9-19" id="en-CEV-8414"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>So Joram sent out another rider, who rode up to Jehu and said, “The king wants to know if this is a friendly visit.”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-9-19">“What's it to you?” Jehu asked. “Just get behind me with the rest of my troops!”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-9-20" id="en-CEV-8415"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>The guard in the watchtower said, “Your Majesty, the rider got there, but he isn't coming back either.

It hit Joram between his shoulders, then it went through his heart and came out his chest. He fell over dead in his chariot.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-9-25-2Kgs-9-26" id="en-CEV-8420"><sup class="versenum">25-26 </sup> Jehu commanded his assistant Bidkar, “Get Joram's body and throw it in the field that Naboth once owned. Do you remember when you and I used to ride side by side behind Joram's father Ahab? It was then that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> swore to Ahab that he would be punished in the same field where he had killed Naboth and his sons.
