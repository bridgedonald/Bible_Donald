He sacrificed his own son, which was a disgusting custom of the nations that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had forced out of Israel. </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-16-4" id="en-CEV-8596"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Ahaz offered sacrifices at the local shrines, as well as on every hill and in the shade of large trees.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-16-5-2Kgs-16-6" id="en-CEV-8597"><sup class="versenum">5-6 </sup> While Ahaz was ruling Judah, the king of Edom recaptured the town of Elath from Judah and forced out the people of Judah.

Please come and rescue me.” </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-16-8" id="en-CEV-8599"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Along with the message, Ahaz sent silver and gold from the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s temple and from the palace treasury as a gift for the Assyrian king.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Kgs-16-9" id="en-CEV-8600"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>As soon as Tiglath Pileser received the message, he and his troops marched to Syria.

He walked up to the altar </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-16-13" id="en-CEV-8604"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>and poured wine over it. Then he offered sacrifices to please the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, to give him thanks, and to ask for his blessings.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-8604c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-8604c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-8604c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-16-14" id="en-CEV-8605"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup> After that, he had the bronze altar moved aside,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-8605d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-8605d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-8605d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> so his new altar would be right in front of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s temple. </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-16-15" id="en-CEV-8606"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>He told Uriah the priest:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 2Kgs-16-15">From now on, the morning and evening sacrifices as well as all gifts of grain and wine are to be offered on this altar. The sacrifices for the people and for the king must also be offered here.

He had the large bronze bowl, called the Sea, removed from the bronze bulls on which it rested and had it placed on a stand made of stone. </span> <span class="text 2Kgs-16-18" id="en-CEV-8609"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>He took down the special tent that was used for worship on the Sabbath<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-8609e" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-8609e" title="See footnote e"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-8609e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> and closed up the private entrance that the kings of Judah used for going into the temple.
