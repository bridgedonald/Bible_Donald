False teachers will also sneak in and speak harmful lies to you. But these teachers don't really belong to the Master who paid a great price for them, and they will quickly destroy themselves. </span> <span class="text 2Pet-2-2" id="en-CEV-28382"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Many people will follow their evil ways and cause others to tell lies about the true way. </span> <span class="text 2Pet-2-3" id="en-CEV-28383"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>They will be greedy and cheat you with smooth talk. But long ago God decided to punish them, and God doesn't sleep.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Pet-2-4" id="en-CEV-28384"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>God did not have pity on the angels that sinned. He had them tied up and thrown into the dark pits of hell until the time of judgment. </span> <span class="text 2Pet-2-5" id="en-CEV-28385"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup> And during Noah's time, God did not have pity on the ungodly people of the world. He destroyed them with a flood, though he did save eight people, including Noah, who preached the truth.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Pet-2-6" id="en-CEV-28386"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup> God punished the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28386a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28386a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28386a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> by burning them to ashes, and this is a warning to anyone else who wants to sin.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Pet-2-7-2Pet-2-8" id="en-CEV-28387"><sup class="versenum">7-8 </sup> Lot lived right and was greatly troubled by the terrible way those wicked people were living. He was a good man, and day after day he suffered because of the evil things he saw and heard. So the Lord rescued him. </span> <span class="text 2Pet-2-9" id="en-CEV-28388"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>This shows that the Lord knows how to rescue godly people from their sufferings and to punish evil people while they wait for the day of judgment.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Pet-2-10" id="en-CEV-28389"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>The Lord is especially hard on people who disobey him and don't think of anything except their own filthy desires. They are reckless and proud and are not afraid of cursing the glorious beings in heaven. </span> <span class="text 2Pet-2-11" id="en-CEV-28390"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Although angels are more powerful than these evil beings,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28390b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28390b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28390b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> even the angels don't dare to accuse them to the Lord.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Pet-2-12" id="en-CEV-28391"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>These people are no better than senseless animals that live by their feelings and are born to be caught and killed. They speak evil of things they don't know anything about. But their own corrupt deeds will destroy them. </span> <span class="text 2Pet-2-13" id="en-CEV-28392"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>They have done evil, and they will be rewarded with evil.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Pet-2-13">They think it is fun to have wild parties during the day.

There is no end to their wicked deeds. They trick people who are easily fooled, and their minds are filled with greedy thoughts. But they are headed for trouble!</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Pet-2-15" id="en-CEV-28394"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup> They have left the true road and have gone down the wrong path by following the example of the prophet Balaam.
