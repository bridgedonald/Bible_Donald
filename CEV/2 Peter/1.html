May you keep learning more and more about God and our Lord Jesus.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 2Pet-1-3" id="en-CEV-28362">Living as the Lord's Followers</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Pet-1-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>We have everything we need to live a life that pleases God. It was all given to us by God's own power, when we learned he had invited us to share in his wonderful goodness. </span> <span class="text 2Pet-1-4" id="en-CEV-28363"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>God made great and marvelous promises, so his nature would become part of us. Then we could escape our evil desires and the corrupt influences of this world.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Pet-1-5" id="en-CEV-28364"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Do your best to improve your faith by adding goodness, understanding, </span> <span class="text 2Pet-1-6" id="en-CEV-28365"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>self-control, patience, devotion to God, </span> <span class="text 2Pet-1-7" id="en-CEV-28366"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>concern for others, and love. </span> <span class="text 2Pet-1-8" id="en-CEV-28367"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>If you keep growing in this way, it will show that what you know about our Lord Jesus Christ has made your lives useful and meaningful. </span> <span class="text 2Pet-1-9" id="en-CEV-28368"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>But if you don't grow, you are like someone who is nearsighted or blind, and you have forgotten that your past sins are forgiven.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Pet-1-10" id="en-CEV-28369"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>My friends, you must do all you can to show God has really chosen and selected you. If you keep on doing this, you won't stumble and fall. </span> <span class="text 2Pet-1-11" id="en-CEV-28370"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Then our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will give you a glorious welcome into his kingdom that will last forever.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Pet-1-12" id="en-CEV-28371"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>You are holding firmly to the truth you were given. But I am still going to remind you of these things. </span> <span class="text 2Pet-1-13" id="en-CEV-28372"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>In fact, I think I should keep on reminding you until I leave this body. </span> <span class="text 2Pet-1-14" id="en-CEV-28373"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>And our Lord Jesus Christ has already told me that I will soon leave it behind. </span> <span class="text 2Pet-1-15" id="en-CEV-28374"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>This is why I am doing my best to make sure that each of you remembers all of this after I am gone.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 2Pet-1-16" id="en-CEV-28375">The Message about the Glory of Christ</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Pet-1-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>When we told you about the power and the return of our Lord Jesus Christ, we were not telling clever stories someone had made up. But with our own eyes we saw his true greatness. </span> <span class="text 2Pet-1-17" id="en-CEV-28376"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup> God, our great and wonderful Father, truly honored him by saying, “This is my own dear Son, and I am pleased with him.” </span> <span class="text 2Pet-1-18" id="en-CEV-28377"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>We were there with Jesus on the holy mountain and heard this voice speak from heaven.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Pet-1-19" id="en-CEV-28378"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>All of this makes us even more certain that what the prophets said is true. So you should pay close attention to their message, as you would to a lamp shining in some dark place. You must keep on paying attention until daylight comes and the morning star rises in your hearts. </span> <span class="text 2Pet-1-20" id="en-CEV-28379"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>But you need to realize that no one alone can understand any of the prophecies in the Scriptures. </span> <span class="text 2Pet-1-21" id="en-CEV-28380"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>The prophets did not think these things up on their own, but they were guided by the Spirit of God.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
