I hope you are as strong in body, as I know you are in spirit. </span> <span class="text 3John-1-3" id="en-CEV-28540"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>It makes me very happy when the Lord's followers come by and speak openly of how you obey the truth. </span> <span class="text 3John-1-4" id="en-CEV-28541"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Nothing brings me greater happiness than to hear that my children<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28541b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28541b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28541b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> are obeying the truth.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 3John-1-5" id="en-CEV-28542">Working Together</span></h3><p><span class="text 3John-1-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Dear friend, you have always been faithful in helping other followers of the Lord, even the ones you didn't know before. </span> <span class="text 3John-1-6" id="en-CEV-28543"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>They have told the church about your love. They say you were good enough to welcome them and to send them on their mission in a way God's servants deserve. </span> <span class="text 3John-1-7" id="en-CEV-28544"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>When they left to tell others about the Lord, they decided not to accept help from anyone who wasn't a follower. </span> <span class="text 3John-1-8" id="en-CEV-28545"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>We must support people like them, so we can take part in what they are doing to spread the truth.</span></p> <p><span class="text 3John-1-9" id="en-CEV-28546"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>I wrote to the church.

Not only has he been doing this, but he refuses to welcome any of the Lord's followers who come by. And when other church members want to welcome them, he puts them out of the church.</span></p> <p><span class="text 3John-1-11" id="en-CEV-28548"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Dear friend, don't imitate the evil deeds of others, but follow the example of people who do kind deeds.
