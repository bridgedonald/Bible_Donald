<h3><span class="text 1Thess-2-1" id="en-CEV-27459">Paul's Work in Thessalonica</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text 1Thess-2-1"><span class="chapternum">2 </span>My friends, you know our time with you wasn't wasted. </span> <span class="text 1Thess-2-2" id="en-CEV-27460"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup> As you remember, we had been mistreated and insulted at Philippi. But God gave us the courage to tell you the good news about him, even though many people caused us trouble. </span> <span class="text 1Thess-2-3" id="en-CEV-27461"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>We didn't have any hidden motives when we won you over, and we didn't try to fool or trick anyone. </span> <span class="text 1Thess-2-4" id="en-CEV-27462"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>God was pleased to trust us with his message. We didn't speak to please people, but to please God who knows our motives.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Thess-2-5" id="en-CEV-27463"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>You also know we didn't try to flatter anyone. God himself knows what we did wasn't a cover-up for greed. </span> <span class="text 1Thess-2-6" id="en-CEV-27464"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>We were not trying to get you or anyone else to praise us. </span> <span class="text 1Thess-2-7" id="en-CEV-27465"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>But as apostles, we could have demanded help from you. After all, Christ is the one who sent us. We chose to be like children or like a mother<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27465a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27465a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27465a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> nursing her baby. </span> <span class="text 1Thess-2-8" id="en-CEV-27466"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>We cared so much for you, and you became so dear to us, that we were willing to give our lives for you when we gave you God's message.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Thess-2-9" id="en-CEV-27467"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>My dear friends, you surely haven't forgotten our hard work and hardships. You remember how night and day we struggled to make a living, so we could tell you God's message without being a burden to anyone. </span> <span class="text 1Thess-2-10" id="en-CEV-27468"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Both you and God are witnesses that we were pure and honest and innocent in our dealings with you followers of the Lord. </span> <span class="text 1Thess-2-11" id="en-CEV-27469"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>You also know we did everything for you that parents would do for their own children. </span> <span class="text 1Thess-2-12" id="en-CEV-27470"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>We begged, encouraged, and urged each of you to live in a way that would honor God. He is the one who chose you to share in his own kingdom and glory.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Thess-2-13" id="en-CEV-27471"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>We always thank God that you believed the message we preached. It came from him, and it isn't something made up by humans. You accepted it as God's message, and now he is working in you. </span> <span class="text 1Thess-2-14" id="en-CEV-27472"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup> My friends, you did just like God's churches in Judea and like the other followers of Christ Jesus there. And so, you were mistreated by your own people, in the same way they were mistreated by their people.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Thess-2-15" id="en-CEV-27473"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup> Those evil people killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and they even chased us away. God doesn't like what they do and neither does anyone else. </span> <span class="text 1Thess-2-16" id="en-CEV-27474"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>They keep us from speaking his message to the Gentiles and from leading them to be saved. They have always gone too far with their sins. Now God has finally become angry and will punish them.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 1Thess-2-17" id="en-CEV-27475">Paul Wants To Visit the Church Again</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Thess-2-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>My friends, we were kept from coming to you for a while, but we never stopped thinking about you. We were eager to see you and tried our best to visit you in person. </span> <span class="text 1Thess-2-18" id="en-CEV-27476"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>We really wanted to come. I myself tried several times, but Satan always stopped us. </span> <span class="text 1Thess-2-19" id="en-CEV-27477"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>After all, when the Lord Jesus appears, who else but you will give us hope and joy and be like a glorious crown for us? </span> <span class="text 1Thess-2-20" id="en-CEV-27478"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>You alone are our glory and joy!</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
