<h3><span class="text Ruth-4-1" id="en-CEV-6020">Ruth and Boaz Get Married</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Ruth-4-1"><span class="chapternum">4 </span>In the meanwhile, Boaz had gone to the meeting place at the town gate and was sitting there when the other close relative came by. So Boaz invited him to come over and sit down, and he did. </span> <span class="text Ruth-4-2" id="en-CEV-6021"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Then Boaz got ten of the town leaders and also asked them to sit down. After they had sat down, </span> <span class="text Ruth-4-3" id="en-CEV-6022"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>he said to the man:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Ruth-4-3">Naomi has come back from Moab and is selling the land that belonged to her husband Elimelech. </span> <span class="text Ruth-4-4" id="en-CEV-6023"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>I'm telling you about this, since you are his closest relative and have the right to buy the property. If you want it, you can buy it now. These ten men and the others standing here can be witnesses. But if you don't want the property, let me know, because I am next in line.</span></p><p><span class="text Ruth-4-4">The man replied, “I'll buy it!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Ruth-4-5" id="en-CEV-6024"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>“If you do buy it from Naomi,” Boaz told him, “you must also marry Ruth. Then if you have a son by her, the property will stay in the family of Ruth's first husband.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Ruth-4-6" id="en-CEV-6025"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>The man answered, “If that's the case, I don't want to buy it! That would make problems with the property I already own.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-6025a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-6025a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-6025a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> You may buy it yourself, because I cannot.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Ruth-4-7" id="en-CEV-6026"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup> To make a sale legal in those days, one person would take off a sandal and give it to the other. </span> <span class="text Ruth-4-8" id="en-CEV-6027"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>So after the man had agreed to let Boaz buy the property, he took off one of his sandals and handed it to Boaz.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ruth-4-9" id="en-CEV-6028"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Boaz told the town leaders and everyone else:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Ruth-4-9">All of you are witnesses that today I have bought from Naomi the property that belonged to Elimelech and his two sons, Chilion and Mahlon. </span> <span class="text Ruth-4-10" id="en-CEV-6029"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup> You are also witnesses that I have agreed to marry Mahlon's widow Ruth, the Moabite woman. This will keep the property in his family's name, and he will be remembered in this town.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ruth-4-11" id="en-CEV-6030"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup> The town leaders and the others standing there said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Ruth-4-11">We are witnesses to this. And we pray that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will give your wife many children, just as he did Leah and Rachel, the wives of Jacob. May you be a rich man in the tribe of Ephrath and an important man in Bethlehem. </span> <span class="text Ruth-4-12" id="en-CEV-6031"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup> May the children you have by this young woman make your family as famous as the family of Perez,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-6031b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-6031b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-6031b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> the son of Tamar and Judah.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ruth-4-13" id="en-CEV-6032"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Boaz married Ruth, and the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> blessed her with a son. </span> <span class="text Ruth-4-14" id="en-CEV-6033"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>After his birth, the women said to Naomi:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Ruth-4-14">Praise the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>!
