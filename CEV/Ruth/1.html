His wife was named Naomi, and their two sons were Mahlon and Chilion. But when their crops failed in Israel, they moved to the country of Moab.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5961a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5961a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5961a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> And while they were there, </span> <span class="text Ruth-1-3" id="en-CEV-5962"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Elimelech died, leaving Naomi with only her two sons.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ruth-1-4" id="en-CEV-5963"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Later, Naomi's sons married Moabite women. One was named Orpah and the other Ruth. About ten years later, </span> <span class="text Ruth-1-5" id="en-CEV-5964"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Mahlon and Chilion also died. Now Naomi had no husband or sons.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ruth-1-6-Ruth-1-7" id="en-CEV-5965"><sup class="versenum">6-7 </sup>When Naomi heard that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had given his people a good harvest, she and her two daughters-in-law got ready to leave Moab and go to Judah.

You were kind to my husband and sons, and you've always been kind to me. I pray that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will be just as kind to you. </span> <span class="text Ruth-1-9" id="en-CEV-5967"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>May he give each of you another husband and a home of your own.”</span></p><p><span class="text Ruth-1-9">Naomi kissed them.
