<h3><span class="text Ruth-2-1-Ruth-2-3" id="en-CEV-5981">Ruth Meets Boaz</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Ruth-2-1-Ruth-2-3"><span class="chapternum">2 </span><sup class="versenum">1-3 </sup> One day, Ruth said to Naomi, “Let me see if I can find someone who will let me pick up the grain left in the fields by the harvest workers.”<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5981a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5981a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5981a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></span></p><p><span class="text Ruth-2-1-Ruth-2-3">Naomi answered, “Go ahead, my daughter.” So immediately Ruth went out to pick up grain in a field. She didn't know it was owned by Boaz, a relative of Naomi's husband Elimelech, as well as a rich and important man.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ruth-2-4" id="en-CEV-5982"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>When Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and went out to his field, he said to the harvest workers, “The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> bless you!”</span></p><p><span class="text Ruth-2-4">They replied, “And may the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> bless you!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Ruth-2-5" id="en-CEV-5983"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Then Boaz asked the man in charge of the harvest workers, “Who is that young woman?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Ruth-2-6" id="en-CEV-5984"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>The man answered, “She is the one who came back from Moab with Naomi. </span> <span class="text Ruth-2-7" id="en-CEV-5985"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>She asked if she could pick up grain left by the harvest workers, and she has been working all morning without a moment's rest.”<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5985b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5985b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5985b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text Ruth-2-8" id="en-CEV-5986"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Boaz went over to Ruth and said, “I think it would be best for you not to pick up grain in anyone else's field. Stay here with the women </span> <span class="text Ruth-2-9" id="en-CEV-5987"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>and follow along behind them, as they gather up what the men have cut. I have warned the men not to bother you, and whenever you are thirsty, you can drink from their water jars.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Ruth-2-10" id="en-CEV-5988"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Ruth bowed down to the ground and said, “You know I come from another country. Why are you so good to me?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Ruth-2-11" id="en-CEV-5989"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Boaz answered, “I've heard how you've helped your mother-in-law ever since your husband died. You even left your own father and mother to come and live in a foreign land among people you don't know. </span> <span class="text Ruth-2-12" id="en-CEV-5990"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>I pray that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God of Israel will reward you for what you have done. And now that you have come to him for protection, I pray that he will bless you.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Ruth-2-13" id="en-CEV-5991"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Ruth replied, “Sir, it's good of you to speak kindly to me and make me feel so welcome. I'm not even one of your servants.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Ruth-2-14" id="en-CEV-5992"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>At mealtime Boaz said to Ruth, “Come, eat with us. Have some bread and dip it in the sauce.” At once she sat down with the workers, and Boaz handed her some roasted grain. Ruth ate all she wanted and had some left over.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ruth-2-15" id="en-CEV-5993"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>When Ruth left to start picking up grain, Boaz told his men, “Don't stop her, even if she picks up grain from where it is stacked. </span> <span class="text Ruth-2-16" id="en-CEV-5994"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Be sure to pull out some stalks of grain from the bundles and leave them on the ground for her. And don't speak harshly to her!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Ruth-2-17" id="en-CEV-5995"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Ruth worked in the field until evening. Then after she had pounded the grain off the stalks, she had a large basket full of grain. </span> <span class="text Ruth-2-18" id="en-CEV-5996"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>She took the grain to town and showed Naomi how much she had picked up. Ruth also gave her the food left over from her lunch.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ruth-2-19" id="en-CEV-5997"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Naomi said, “Where did you work today? Whose field was it? God bless the man who treated you so well!” Then Ruth told her that she had worked in the field of a man named Boaz.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ruth-2-20" id="en-CEV-5998"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup> “The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> bless Boaz!” Naomi replied. “He<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5998c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5998c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5998c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> has shown that he is still loyal to the living and to the dead. Boaz is a close relative, one of those who is supposed to look after us.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Ruth-2-21" id="en-CEV-5999"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Ruth told her, “Boaz even said I could stay in the field with his workers until they had finished harvesting all his grain.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Ruth-2-22" id="en-CEV-6000"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Naomi replied, “My daughter, it's good that you can pick up grain alongside the women who work in his field. Who knows what might happen to you in someone else's field!” </span> <span class="text Ruth-2-23" id="en-CEV-6001"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>And so, Ruth stayed close to the women, while picking up grain in his field.</span></p><p><span class="text Ruth-2-23">Ruth worked in the fields until the barley and wheat were harvested. And all this time she lived with Naomi.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
