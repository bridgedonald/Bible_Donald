Why have you lied to the Holy Spirit? </span> <span class="text Acts-5-4" id="en-CEV-24985"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>The property was yours before you sold it, and even after you sold it, the money was still yours.

Then they took it out and buried it.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-5-7" id="en-CEV-24988"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Three hours later Sapphira came in, but she did not know what had happened to her husband. </span> <span class="text Acts-5-8" id="en-CEV-24989"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Peter asked her, “Tell me, did you sell the property for this amount?”</span></p><p><span class="text Acts-5-8">“Yes,” she answered, “that's the amount.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-5-9" id="en-CEV-24990"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Then Peter said, “Why did the two of you agree to test the Lord's Spirit? The men who buried Ananias are by the door, and they will carry you out!” </span> <span class="text Acts-5-10" id="en-CEV-24991"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>At once she fell at Peter's feet and died.</span></p><p><span class="text Acts-5-10">When the young men came back in, they found Sapphira lying there dead. So they carried her out and buried her beside her husband. </span> <span class="text Acts-5-11" id="en-CEV-24992"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>The church members were afraid, and so was everyone else who heard what had happened.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Acts-5-12" id="en-CEV-24993">Peter's Unusual Power</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-5-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>The apostles worked many miracles and wonders among the people.

Then they ordered the apostles to be brought to them from the jail. </span> <span class="text Acts-5-22" id="en-CEV-25003"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>The temple police who were sent to the jail did not find the apostles. They returned and said, </span> <span class="text Acts-5-23" id="en-CEV-25004"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>“We found the jail locked tight and the guards standing at the doors. But when we opened the doors and went in, we didn't find anyone there.” </span> <span class="text Acts-5-24" id="en-CEV-25005"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>The captain of the temple police and the chief priests listened to their report, but they did not know what to think about it.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-5-25" id="en-CEV-25006"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Just then someone came in and said, “Now those men you put in jail are in the temple, teaching the people!” </span> <span class="text Acts-5-26" id="en-CEV-25007"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>The captain went with some of the temple police and brought the apostles back.

But look what you have done! You have been teaching all over Jerusalem, and you are trying to blame us for his death.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-5-29" id="en-CEV-25010"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>Peter and the apostles replied:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-5-29">We don't obey people. We obey God. </span> <span class="text Acts-5-30" id="en-CEV-25011"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>You killed Jesus by nailing him to a cross. But the God our ancestors worshiped raised him to life </span> <span class="text Acts-5-31" id="en-CEV-25012"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>and made him our Leader and Savior. Then God gave him a place at his right side,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-25012b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-25012b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-25012b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> so that the people of Israel would turn back to him and be forgiven. </span> <span class="text Acts-5-32" id="en-CEV-25013"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>We are here to tell you about all this, and so is the Holy Spirit, who is God's gift to everyone who obeys God.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-5-33" id="en-CEV-25014"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>When the council members heard this, they became so angry they wanted to kill the apostles. </span> <span class="text Acts-5-34" id="en-CEV-25015"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>But one of the members was the Pharisee Gamaliel, a highly respected teacher. He ordered the apostles to be taken out of the room for a little while. </span> <span class="text Acts-5-35" id="en-CEV-25016"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>Then he said to the council:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-5-35">Men of Israel, be careful what you do with these men. </span> <span class="text Acts-5-36" id="en-CEV-25017"><sup class="versenum">36 </sup>Not long ago Theudas claimed to be someone important, and about 400 men joined him.

Leave them alone. If what they are planning is something of their own doing, it will fail. </span> <span class="text Acts-5-39" id="en-CEV-25020"><sup class="versenum">39 </sup> But if God is behind it, you cannot stop it anyway, unless you want to fight against God.</span></p><p><span class="text Acts-5-39">The council members agreed with what he said, </span> <span class="text Acts-5-40" id="en-CEV-25021"><sup class="versenum">40 </sup>and they called the apostles back in. They had them beaten with a whip and warned them not to speak in the name of Jesus.
