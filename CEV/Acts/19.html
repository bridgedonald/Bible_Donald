But he also told them someone else was coming, and they should put their faith in him. Jesus is the one that John was talking about.” </span> <span class="text Acts-19-5" id="en-CEV-25507"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>After the people heard Paul say this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. </span> <span class="text Acts-19-6" id="en-CEV-25508"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Then Paul placed his hands on them. The Holy Spirit was given to them, and they spoke unknown languages and prophesied. </span> <span class="text Acts-19-7" id="en-CEV-25509"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>There were about twelve men in this group.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-19-8" id="en-CEV-25510"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>For three months Paul went to the synagogue and talked bravely with the people about God's kingdom. He tried to win them over, </span> <span class="text Acts-19-9" id="en-CEV-25511"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>but some of them were stubborn and refused to believe. In front of everyone they said terrible things about God's Way. Paul left and took the followers with him to the lecture hall of Tyrannus. He spoke there every day </span> <span class="text Acts-19-10" id="en-CEV-25512"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>for two years, until every Jew and Gentile<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-25512b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-25512b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-25512b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> in Asia had heard the Lord's message.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Acts-19-11" id="en-CEV-25513">The Sons of Sceva</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-19-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>God gave Paul the power to work great miracles. </span> <span class="text Acts-19-12" id="en-CEV-25514"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>People even took handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched Paul's body, and they carried them to everyone who was sick. All of the sick people were healed, and the evil spirits went out.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-19-13" id="en-CEV-25515"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Some Jewish men started going around trying to force out evil spirits by using the name of the Lord Jesus. They said to the spirits, “Come out in the name of that same Jesus that Paul preaches about!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-19-14" id="en-CEV-25516"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Seven sons of a high priest named Sceva were doing this, </span> <span class="text Acts-19-15" id="en-CEV-25517"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>when an evil spirit said to them, “I know Jesus! And I have heard about Paul. But who are you?” </span> <span class="text Acts-19-16" id="en-CEV-25518"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Then the man with the evil spirit jumped on them and beat them up. They ran out of the house, naked and bruised.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-19-17" id="en-CEV-25519"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>When the Jews and Gentiles<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-25519c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-25519c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-25519c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> in Ephesus heard about this, they were so frightened that they praised the name of the Lord Jesus. </span> <span class="text Acts-19-18" id="en-CEV-25520"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Many who were followers now started telling everyone about the evil things they had been doing. </span> <span class="text Acts-19-19" id="en-CEV-25521"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Some who had been practicing witchcraft even brought their books and burned them in public. These books were worth about 50,000 silver coins. </span> <span class="text Acts-19-20" id="en-CEV-25522"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>So the Lord's message spread and became even more powerful.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Acts-19-21" id="en-CEV-25523">The Riot in Ephesus</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-19-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>After all this had happened, Paul decided<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-25523d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-25523d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-25523d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> to visit Macedonia and Achaia on his way to Jerusalem. Paul had said, “From there I will go on to Rome.” </span> <span class="text Acts-19-22" id="en-CEV-25524"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>So he sent his two helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia. But he stayed on in Asia for a while.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-19-23" id="en-CEV-25525"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>At that time there was serious trouble because of the Lord's Way.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-25525e" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-25525e" title="See footnote e"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-25525e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Acts-19-24" id="en-CEV-25526"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>A silversmith named Demetrius had a business that made silver models of the temple of the goddess Artemis. Those who worked for him earned a lot of money. </span> <span class="text Acts-19-25" id="en-CEV-25527"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Demetrius brought together everyone who was in the same business and said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-19-25">Friends, you know we make a good living at this. </span> <span class="text Acts-19-26" id="en-CEV-25528"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>But you have surely seen and heard how this man Paul is upsetting a lot of people, not only in Ephesus, but almost everywhere in Asia. He claims that the gods we humans make are not really gods at all. </span> <span class="text Acts-19-27" id="en-CEV-25529"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>Everyone will start saying terrible things about our business. They will stop respecting the temple of the goddess Artemis, who is worshiped in Asia and all over the world. Our great goddess will be forgotten!</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-19-28" id="en-CEV-25530"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>When the workers heard this, they got angry and started shouting, “Great is Artemis, the goddess of the Ephesians!” </span> <span class="text Acts-19-29" id="en-CEV-25531"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>Soon the whole city was in a riot, and some men grabbed Gaius and Aristarchus, who had come from Macedonia with Paul. Then everyone in the crowd rushed to the place where the town meetings were held.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-19-30" id="en-CEV-25532"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>Paul wanted to go out and speak to the people, but the Lord's followers would not let him. </span> <span class="text Acts-19-31" id="en-CEV-25533"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>A few of the local officials were friendly to Paul, and they sent someone to warn him not to go.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-19-32" id="en-CEV-25534"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>Some of the people in the meeting were shouting one thing, and others were shouting something else. Everyone was completely confused, and most of them did not even know why they were there.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-19-33" id="en-CEV-25535"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>Several of the Jewish leaders pushed a man named Alexander to the front of the crowd and started telling him what to say. He motioned with his hand and tried to explain what was going on. </span> <span class="text Acts-19-34" id="en-CEV-25536"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>But when the crowd saw that he was Jewish, they all shouted for two hours, “Great is Artemis, the goddess of the Ephesians!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-19-35" id="en-CEV-25537"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>Finally, a town official made the crowd be quiet. Then he said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-19-35">People of Ephesus, who in the world doesn't know that our city is the center for worshiping the great goddess Artemis? Who doesn't know that her image which fell from heaven is right here? </span> <span class="text Acts-19-36" id="en-CEV-25538"><sup class="versenum">36 </sup>No one can deny this, and so you should calm down and not do anything foolish. </span> <span class="text Acts-19-37" id="en-CEV-25539"><sup class="versenum">37 </sup>You have brought men in here who have not robbed temples or spoken against our goddess.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-19-38" id="en-CEV-25540"><sup class="versenum">38 </sup>If Demetrius and his workers have a case against these men, we have courts and judges. Let them take their complaints there. </span> <span class="text Acts-19-39" id="en-CEV-25541"><sup class="versenum">39 </sup>But if you want to do more than that, the matter will have to be brought before the city council. </span> <span class="text Acts-19-40" id="en-CEV-25542"><sup class="versenum">40 </sup>We could easily be accused of starting a riot today. There is no excuse for it! We cannot even give a reason for this uproar.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-19-41" id="en-CEV-25543"><sup class="versenum">41 </sup>After saying this, he told the people to leave.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
