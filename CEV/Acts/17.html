<h3><span class="text Acts-17-1" id="en-CEV-25441">Trouble in Thessalonica</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Acts-17-1"><span class="chapternum">17 </span>After Paul and his friends had traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they went on to Thessalonica. A synagogue was in that city. </span> <span class="text Acts-17-2" id="en-CEV-25442"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>So as usual, Paul went there to worship, and on three Sabbaths he spoke to the people. He used the Scriptures </span> <span class="text Acts-17-3" id="en-CEV-25443"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>to show them that the Messiah had to suffer, but that he would rise from death. Paul also told them that Jesus is the Messiah he was preaching about. </span> <span class="text Acts-17-4" id="en-CEV-25444"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Some of them believed what Paul had said, and they became followers with Paul and Silas. Some Gentiles<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-25444a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-25444a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-25444a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> and many important women also believed the message.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-17-5" id="en-CEV-25445"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>The Jewish leaders were jealous and got some troublemakers who hung around the marketplace to start a riot in the city. They wanted to drag Paul and Silas out to the mob, and so they went straight to Jason's home. </span> <span class="text Acts-17-6" id="en-CEV-25446"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>But when they did not find them there, they dragged out Jason and some of the Lord's followers. They took them to the city authorities and shouted, “Paul and Silas have been upsetting things everywhere. Now they have come here, </span> <span class="text Acts-17-7" id="en-CEV-25447"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>and Jason has welcomed them into his home. All of them break the laws of the Roman Emperor by claiming that someone named Jesus is king.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-17-8" id="en-CEV-25448"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>The officials and the people were upset when they heard this. </span> <span class="text Acts-17-9" id="en-CEV-25449"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>So they made Jason and the other followers pay bail before letting them go.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Acts-17-10" id="en-CEV-25450">People in Berea Welcome the Message</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-17-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>That same night the Lord's followers sent Paul and Silas on to Berea, and after they arrived, they went to the synagogue. </span> <span class="text Acts-17-11" id="en-CEV-25451"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>The people in Berea were much nicer than those in Thessalonica, and they gladly accepted the message. Day after day they studied the Scriptures to see if these things were true. </span> <span class="text Acts-17-12" id="en-CEV-25452"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Many of them put their faith in the Lord, including some important Greek women and several men.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-17-13" id="en-CEV-25453"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>When the Jewish leaders in Thessalonica heard that Paul had been preaching God's message in Berea, they went there and caused trouble by turning the crowds against Paul.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-17-14" id="en-CEV-25454"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>At once the followers sent Paul down to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed in Berea. </span> <span class="text Acts-17-15" id="en-CEV-25455"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Some men went with Paul as far as Athens, and then returned with instructions for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Acts-17-16" id="en-CEV-25456">Paul in Athens</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-17-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>While Paul was waiting in Athens, he was upset to see all the idols in the city. </span> <span class="text Acts-17-17" id="en-CEV-25457"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>He went to the synagogue to speak to the Jews and to anyone who worshiped with them. Day after day he also spoke to everyone he met in the market. </span> <span class="text Acts-17-18" id="en-CEV-25458"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Some of them were Epicureans<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-25458b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-25458b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-25458b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> and some were Stoics,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-25458c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-25458c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-25458c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> and they started arguing with him.</span></p><p><span class="text Acts-17-18">People were asking, “What is this know-it-all trying to say?”</span></p><p><span class="text Acts-17-18">Some even said, “Paul must be preaching about foreign gods! That's what he means when he talks about Jesus and about people rising from death.”<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-25458d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-25458d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-25458d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-17-19" id="en-CEV-25459"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>They brought Paul before a council called the Areopagus, and said, “Tell us what your new teaching is all about. </span> <span class="text Acts-17-20" id="en-CEV-25460"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>We have heard you say some strange things, and we want to know what you mean.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-17-21" id="en-CEV-25461"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>More than anything else the people of Athens and the foreigners living there loved to hear and to talk about anything new. </span> <span class="text Acts-17-22" id="en-CEV-25462"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>So Paul stood up in front of the council and said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-17-22">People of Athens, I see that you are very religious. </span> <span class="text Acts-17-23" id="en-CEV-25463"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup> As I was going through your city and looking at the things you worship, I found an altar with the words, “To an Unknown God.” You worship this God, but you don't really know him. So I want to tell you about him. </span> <span class="text Acts-17-24" id="en-CEV-25464"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup> This God made the world and everything in it. He is Lord of heaven and earth, and he doesn't live in temples built by human hands. </span> <span class="text Acts-17-25" id="en-CEV-25465"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup> He doesn't need help from anyone. He gives life, breath, and everything else to all people. </span> <span class="text Acts-17-26" id="en-CEV-25466"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup> From one person God made all nations who live on earth, and he decided when and where every nation would be.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-17-27" id="en-CEV-25467"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup> God has done all this, so that we will look for him and reach out and find him. He isn't far from any of us, </span> <span class="text Acts-17-28" id="en-CEV-25468"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>and he gives us the power to live, to move, and to be who we are. “We are his children,” just as some of your poets have said.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-17-29" id="en-CEV-25469"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>Since we are God's children, we must not think that he is like an idol made out of gold or silver or stone. He isn't like anything that humans have thought up and made. </span> <span class="text Acts-17-30" id="en-CEV-25470"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>In the past, God forgave all this because people did not know what they were doing. But now he says that everyone everywhere must turn to him. </span> <span class="text Acts-17-31" id="en-CEV-25471"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>He has set a day when he will judge the world's people with fairness. And he has chosen the man Jesus to do the judging for him. God has given proof of this to all of us by raising Jesus from death.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-17-32" id="en-CEV-25472"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>As soon as the people heard Paul say a man had been raised from death, some of them started laughing. Others said, “We will hear you talk about this some other time.” </span> <span class="text Acts-17-33" id="en-CEV-25473"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>When Paul left the council meeting, </span> <span class="text Acts-17-34" id="en-CEV-25474"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>some of the men put their faith in the Lord and went with Paul. One of them was a council member named Dionysius. A woman named Damaris and several others also put their faith in the Lord.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
