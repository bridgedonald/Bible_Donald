<h3><span class="text Acts-18-1" id="en-CEV-25475">Paul in Corinth</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Acts-18-1"><span class="chapternum">18 </span>Paul left Athens and went to Corinth, </span> <span class="text Acts-18-2" id="en-CEV-25476"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>where he met Aquila, a Jewish man from Pontus. Not long before this, Aquila had come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Emperor Claudius had ordered the Jewish people to leave Rome.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-25476a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-25476a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-25476a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> Paul went to see Aquila and Priscilla </span> <span class="text Acts-18-3" id="en-CEV-25477"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>and found out they were tent makers. Paul was also a tent maker, so he stayed with them, and they worked together.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-18-4" id="en-CEV-25478"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Every Sabbath, Paul went to the synagogue. He spoke to Jews and Gentiles<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-25478b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-25478b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-25478b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> and tried to win them over. </span> <span class="text Acts-18-5" id="en-CEV-25479"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>But after Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, he spent all his time preaching to the Jews about Jesus the Messiah. </span> <span class="text Acts-18-6" id="en-CEV-25480"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Finally, they turned against him and insulted him. So he shook the dust from his clothes<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-25480c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-25480c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-25480c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> and told them, “Whatever happens to you will be your own fault! I am not to blame. From now on I am going to preach to the Gentiles.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-18-7" id="en-CEV-25481"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Paul then moved into the house of a man named Titius Justus, who worshiped God and lived next door to the synagogue. </span> <span class="text Acts-18-8" id="en-CEV-25482"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Crispus was the leader of the synagogue. He and everyone in his family put their faith in the Lord. Many others in Corinth also heard the message, and all the people who had faith in the Lord were baptized.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-18-9" id="en-CEV-25483"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>One night, Paul had a vision, and in it the Lord said, “Don't be afraid to keep on preaching. Don't stop! </span> <span class="text Acts-18-10" id="en-CEV-25484"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>I am with you, and you won't be harmed. Many people in this city belong to me.” </span> <span class="text Acts-18-11" id="en-CEV-25485"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Paul stayed on in Corinth for a year and a half, teaching God's message to the people.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-18-12" id="en-CEV-25486"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>While Gallio was governor of Achaia, some of the Jewish leaders got together and grabbed Paul. They brought him into court </span> <span class="text Acts-18-13" id="en-CEV-25487"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>and said, “This man is trying to make our people worship God in a way that is against our Law!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-18-14" id="en-CEV-25488"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Even before Paul could speak, Gallio said, “If you were charging this man with a crime or some other wrong, I would have to listen to you. </span> <span class="text Acts-18-15" id="en-CEV-25489"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>But since this concerns only words, names, and your own law, you will have to take care of it yourselves. I refuse to judge such matters.” </span> <span class="text Acts-18-16" id="en-CEV-25490"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Then he sent them out of the court. </span> <span class="text Acts-18-17" id="en-CEV-25491"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>The crowd grabbed Sosthenes, the Jewish leader, and beat him up in front of the court. But none of this mattered to Gallio.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Acts-18-18" id="en-CEV-25492">Paul Returns to Antioch in Syria</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-18-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup> After Paul had stayed for a while with the Lord's followers in Corinth, he told them goodbye and sailed on to Syria with Aquila and Priscilla. But before he left, he had his head shaved<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-25492d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-25492d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-25492d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> at Cenchreae because he had made a promise to God.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-18-19" id="en-CEV-25493"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>The three of them arrived in Ephesus, where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila. He then went into the synagogue to talk with the people there. </span> <span class="text Acts-18-20" id="en-CEV-25494"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>They asked him to stay longer, but he refused. </span> <span class="text Acts-18-21" id="en-CEV-25495"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>He told them goodbye and said, “If God lets me, I will come back.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-18-22" id="en-CEV-25496"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Paul sailed to Caesarea, where he greeted the church. Then he went on to Antioch. </span> <span class="text Acts-18-23" id="en-CEV-25497"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>After staying there for a while, he left and visited several places in Galatia and Phrygia. He helped the followers there to become stronger in their faith.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Acts-18-24" id="en-CEV-25498">Apollos in Ephesus</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-18-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>A Jewish man named Apollos came to Ephesus. Apollos had been born in the city of Alexandria. He was a very good speaker and knew a lot about the Scriptures. </span> <span class="text Acts-18-25" id="en-CEV-25499"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>He also knew much about the Lord's Way,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-25499e" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-25499e" title="See footnote e"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-25499e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> and he spoke about it with great excitement. What he taught about Jesus was right, but all he knew was John's message about baptism.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-18-26" id="en-CEV-25500"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>Apollos started speaking bravely in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him to their home and helped him understand God's Way even better.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-18-27" id="en-CEV-25501"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>Apollos decided to travel through Achaia. So the Lord's followers wrote letters, encouraging the followers there to welcome him. After Apollos arrived in Achaia, he was a great help to everyone who had put their faith in the Lord Jesus because of God's gift of undeserved grace. </span> <span class="text Acts-18-28" id="en-CEV-25502"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>He got into fierce arguments with the Jewish people, and in public he used the Scriptures to prove that Jesus is the Messiah.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
