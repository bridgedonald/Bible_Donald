So he brought money </span> <span class="text Acts-8-19" id="en-CEV-25116"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>and said to Peter and John, “Let me have this power too! Then anyone I place my hands on will also be given the Holy Spirit.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-8-20" id="en-CEV-25117"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Peter said to him, “You and your money will both end up in hell if you think you can buy God's gift! </span> <span class="text Acts-8-21" id="en-CEV-25118"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>You don't have any part in this, and God sees that your heart isn't right. </span> <span class="text Acts-8-22" id="en-CEV-25119"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Get rid of these evil thoughts and ask God to forgive you. </span> <span class="text Acts-8-23" id="en-CEV-25120"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>I can see that you are jealous and bound by your evil ways.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-8-24" id="en-CEV-25121"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>Simon said, “Please pray to the Lord, so that what you said won't happen to me.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-8-25" id="en-CEV-25122"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>After Peter and John had preached about the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem.
