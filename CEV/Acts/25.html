<h3><span class="text Acts-25-1" id="en-CEV-25711">Paul Asks To Be Tried by the Roman Emperor</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Acts-25-1"><span class="chapternum">25 </span>Three days after Festus had become governor, he went from Caesarea to Jerusalem. </span> <span class="text Acts-25-2" id="en-CEV-25712"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>There the chief priests and some Jewish leaders told him about their charges against Paul. They also asked Festus </span> <span class="text Acts-25-3" id="en-CEV-25713"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>if he would be willing to bring Paul to Jerusalem. They begged him to do this because they were planning to attack and kill Paul on the way. </span> <span class="text Acts-25-4" id="en-CEV-25714"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>But Festus told them, “Paul will be kept in Caesarea, and I am soon going there myself. </span> <span class="text Acts-25-5" id="en-CEV-25715"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>If he has done anything wrong, let your leaders go with me and bring charges against him there.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-25-6" id="en-CEV-25716"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Festus stayed in Jerusalem for eight or ten more days before going to Caesarea. Then the next day he took his place as judge and had Paul brought into court. </span> <span class="text Acts-25-7" id="en-CEV-25717"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>As soon as Paul came in, the leaders from Jerusalem crowded around him and said he was guilty of many serious crimes. But they could not prove anything. </span> <span class="text Acts-25-8" id="en-CEV-25718"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Then Paul spoke in his own defense, “I have not broken the Law of my people. And I have not done anything against either the temple or the Emperor.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-25-9" id="en-CEV-25719"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Festus wanted to please the leaders. So he asked Paul, “Are you willing to go to Jerusalem and be tried by me on these charges?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-25-10" id="en-CEV-25720"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Paul replied, “I am on trial in the Emperor's court, and that's where I should be tried. You know very well I have not done anything to harm the Jewish nation. </span> <span class="text Acts-25-11" id="en-CEV-25721"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>If I had done something deserving death, I would not ask to escape the death penalty. But I am not guilty of any of these crimes, and no one has the right to hand me over to these people. I now ask to be tried by the Emperor himself.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-25-12" id="en-CEV-25722"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>After Festus had talked this over with members of his council, he told Paul, “You have asked to be tried by the Emperor, and to the Emperor you will go!”</span></p> <h3><span class="text Acts-25-13" id="en-CEV-25723">Paul Speaks to Agrippa and Bernice</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-25-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>A few days later King Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to visit Festus. </span> <span class="text Acts-25-14" id="en-CEV-25724"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>They had been there for several days, when Festus told the king about the charges against Paul. He said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-25-14">Felix left a man here in jail, </span> <span class="text Acts-25-15" id="en-CEV-25725"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>and when I went to Jerusalem, the chief priests and the Jewish leaders came and asked me to find him guilty. </span> <span class="text Acts-25-16" id="en-CEV-25726"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>I told them it isn't the Roman custom to hand a man over to people who are bringing charges against him. He must first have the chance to meet them face to face and to defend himself against their charges.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-25-17" id="en-CEV-25727"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>So when they came here with me, I wasted no time. On the very next day I took my place on the judge's bench and ordered him to be brought in. </span> <span class="text Acts-25-18" id="en-CEV-25728"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>But when the men stood up to make their charges against him, they did not accuse him of any of the crimes that I thought they would. </span> <span class="text Acts-25-19" id="en-CEV-25729"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Instead, they argued with him about some of their beliefs and about a dead man named Jesus, who Paul said was alive.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-25-20" id="en-CEV-25730"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Since I did not know how to find out the truth about all this, I asked Paul if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem and be put on trial there. </span> <span class="text Acts-25-21" id="en-CEV-25731"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>But Paul asked to be kept in jail until the Emperor could decide his case. So I ordered him to be kept here until I could send him to the Emperor.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-25-22" id="en-CEV-25732"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Then Agrippa said to Festus, “I would also like to hear what this man has to say.”</span></p><p><span class="text Acts-25-22">Festus answered, “You can hear him tomorrow.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-25-23" id="en-CEV-25733"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>The next day Agrippa and Bernice made a big show as they came into the meeting room. High ranking army officers and leading citizens of the town were also there. Festus then ordered Paul to be brought in </span> <span class="text Acts-25-24" id="en-CEV-25734"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>and said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-25-24">King Agrippa and other guests, look at this man! Every Jew from Jerusalem and Caesarea has come to me, demanding for him to be put to death. </span> <span class="text Acts-25-25" id="en-CEV-25735"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>I have not found him guilty of any crime deserving death. But because he has asked to be judged by the Emperor, I have decided to send him to Rome.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-25-26" id="en-CEV-25736"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>I have to write some facts about this man to the Emperor. So I have brought him before all of you, but especially before you, King Agrippa. After we have talked about his case, I will then have something to write. </span> <span class="text Acts-25-27" id="en-CEV-25737"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>It makes no sense to send a prisoner to the Emperor without stating the charges against him.</span></p> </div>
