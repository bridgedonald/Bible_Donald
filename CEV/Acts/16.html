<h3><span class="text Acts-16-1" id="en-CEV-25401">Timothy Works with Paul and Silas</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Acts-16-1"><span class="chapternum">16 </span>Paul and Silas went back to Derbe and Lystra, where there was a follower named Timothy. His mother was also a follower. She was Jewish, and his father was Greek. </span> <span class="text Acts-16-2" id="en-CEV-25402"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>The Lord's followers in Lystra and Iconium said good things about Timothy, </span> <span class="text Acts-16-3" id="en-CEV-25403"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>and Paul wanted him to go with them. But Paul first had him circumcised, because all the Jewish people around there knew that Timothy's father was Greek.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-25403a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-25403a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-25403a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-16-4" id="en-CEV-25404"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>As Paul and the others went from city to city, they told the followers what the apostles and leaders in Jerusalem had decided, and they urged them to follow these instructions. </span> <span class="text Acts-16-5" id="en-CEV-25405"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>The churches became stronger in their faith, and each day more people put their faith in the Lord.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Acts-16-6" id="en-CEV-25406">Paul's Vision in Troas</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-16-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Paul and his friends went through Phrygia and Galatia, but the Holy Spirit would not let them preach in Asia. </span> <span class="text Acts-16-7" id="en-CEV-25407"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>After they arrived in Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus would not let them. </span> <span class="text Acts-16-8" id="en-CEV-25408"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>So they went on through<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-25408b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-25408b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-25408b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> Mysia until they came to Troas.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-16-9" id="en-CEV-25409"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>During the night, Paul had a vision of someone from Macedonia who was standing there and begging him, “Come over to Macedonia and help us!” </span> <span class="text Acts-16-10" id="en-CEV-25410"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>After Paul had seen the vision, we began looking for a way to go to Macedonia. We were sure that God had called us to preach the good news there.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Acts-16-11" id="en-CEV-25411">Lydia Becomes a Follower of the Lord</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-16-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>We sailed straight from Troas to Samothrace, and the next day we arrived in Neapolis. </span> <span class="text Acts-16-12" id="en-CEV-25412"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>From there we went to Philippi, which is a Roman colony in the first district of Macedonia.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-25412c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-25412c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-25412c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup></span></p><p><span class="text Acts-16-12">We spent several days in Philippi. </span> <span class="text Acts-16-13" id="en-CEV-25413"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Then on the Sabbath we went outside the city gate to a place by the river, where we thought there would be a Jewish meeting place for prayer. We sat down and talked with the women who came. </span> <span class="text Acts-16-14" id="en-CEV-25414"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>One of them was Lydia, who was from the city of Thyatira and sold expensive purple cloth. She was a worshiper of the Lord God, and he made her willing to accept what Paul was saying. </span> <span class="text Acts-16-15" id="en-CEV-25415"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Then after she and her family were baptized, she kept on begging us, “If you think I really do have faith in the Lord, come stay in my home.” Finally, we accepted her invitation.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Acts-16-16" id="en-CEV-25416">Paul and Silas Are Put in Jail</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-16-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>One day on our way to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl. She had a spirit in her that gave her the power to tell the future. By doing this she made a lot of money for her owners. </span> <span class="text Acts-16-17" id="en-CEV-25417"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>The girl followed Paul and the rest of us, and she kept yelling, “These men are servants of the Most High God! They are telling you how to be saved.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-16-18" id="en-CEV-25418"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>This went on for several days. Finally, Paul got so upset that he turned and said to the spirit, “In the name of Jesus Christ, I order you to leave this girl alone!” At once the evil spirit left her.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-16-19" id="en-CEV-25419"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>When the girl's owners realized they had lost all chances for making more money, they grabbed Paul and Silas and dragged them into court. </span> <span class="text Acts-16-20" id="en-CEV-25420"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>They told the officials, “These Jews are upsetting our city! </span> <span class="text Acts-16-21" id="en-CEV-25421"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>They are telling us to do things we Romans are not allowed to do.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-16-22" id="en-CEV-25422"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>The crowd joined in the attack on Paul and Silas. Then the officials tore the clothes off the two men and ordered them to be beaten with a whip. </span> <span class="text Acts-16-23" id="en-CEV-25423"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>After they had been badly beaten, they were put in jail, and the jailer was told to guard them carefully. </span> <span class="text Acts-16-24" id="en-CEV-25424"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>The jailer did as he was told. He put them deep inside the jail and chained their feet to heavy blocks of wood.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-16-25" id="en-CEV-25425"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing praises to God, while the other prisoners listened. </span> <span class="text Acts-16-26" id="en-CEV-25426"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>Suddenly a strong earthquake shook the jail to its foundations. The doors opened, and the chains fell from all the prisoners.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-16-27" id="en-CEV-25427"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>When the jailer woke up and saw that the doors were open, he thought that the prisoners had escaped. He pulled out his sword and was about to kill himself. </span> <span class="text Acts-16-28" id="en-CEV-25428"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>But Paul shouted, “Don't harm yourself! No one has escaped.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-16-29" id="en-CEV-25429"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>The jailer asked for a torch and went into the jail. He was shaking all over as he knelt down in front of Paul and Silas. </span> <span class="text Acts-16-30" id="en-CEV-25430"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>After he had led them out of the jail, he asked, “What must I do to be saved?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-16-31" id="en-CEV-25431"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>They replied, “Have faith in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved! This is also true for everyone who lives in your home.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-16-32" id="en-CEV-25432"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>Then Paul and Silas told him and everyone else in his house about the Lord. </span> <span class="text Acts-16-33" id="en-CEV-25433"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>While it was still night, the jailer took them to a place where he could wash their cuts and bruises. Then he and everyone in his home were baptized. </span> <span class="text Acts-16-34" id="en-CEV-25434"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>They were very glad they had put their faith in God. After this, the jailer took Paul and Silas to his home and gave them something to eat.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-16-35" id="en-CEV-25435"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>The next morning the officials sent some police with orders for the jailer to let Paul and Silas go. </span> <span class="text Acts-16-36" id="en-CEV-25436"><sup class="versenum">36 </sup>The jailer told Paul, “The officials have ordered me to set you free. Now you can leave in peace.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-16-37" id="en-CEV-25437"><sup class="versenum">37 </sup>But Paul told the police, “We are Roman citizens,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-25437d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-25437d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-25437d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> and the Roman officials had us beaten in public without giving us a trial. They threw us into jail. Now do they think they can secretly send us away? No, they cannot! They will have to come here themselves and let us out.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-16-38" id="en-CEV-25438"><sup class="versenum">38 </sup>When the police told the officials that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, the officials were afraid. </span> <span class="text Acts-16-39" id="en-CEV-25439"><sup class="versenum">39 </sup>So they came and apologized. They led them out of the jail and asked them to please leave town. </span> <span class="text Acts-16-40" id="en-CEV-25440"><sup class="versenum">40 </sup>But Paul and Silas went straight to the home of Lydia, where they saw the Lord's followers and encouraged them. Then they left.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
