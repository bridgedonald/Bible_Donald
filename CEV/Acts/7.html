<h3><span class="text Acts-7-1" id="en-CEV-25039">Stephen's Speech</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Acts-7-1"><span class="chapternum">7 </span>The high priest asked Stephen, “Are they telling the truth about you?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-7-2" id="en-CEV-25040"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup> Stephen answered:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-7-2">Friends, listen to me. Our glorious God appeared to our ancestor Abraham while he was still in Mesopotamia, before he had moved to Haran. </span> <span class="text Acts-7-3" id="en-CEV-25041"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>God told him, “Leave your country and your relatives and go to a land that I will show you.” </span> <span class="text Acts-7-4" id="en-CEV-25042"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup> Then Abraham left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran.</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-7-4">After his father died, Abraham came and settled in this land where you now live. </span> <span class="text Acts-7-5" id="en-CEV-25043"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup> God didn't give him any part of it, not even a square meter. But God did promise to give it to him and his family forever, even though Abraham didn't have any children. </span> <span class="text Acts-7-6" id="en-CEV-25044"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup> God said Abraham's descendants would live for a while in a foreign land. There they would be slaves and would be mistreated 400 years. </span> <span class="text Acts-7-7" id="en-CEV-25045"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup> But he also said, “I will punish the nation that makes them slaves. Then later they will come and worship me in this place.”</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-7-8" id="en-CEV-25046"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup> God said to Abraham, “Every son in each family must be circumcised to show you have kept your agreement with me.” So when Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him. Later, Isaac circumcised his son Jacob, and Jacob circumcised his twelve sons. </span> <span class="text Acts-7-9" id="en-CEV-25047"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup> These men were our ancestors.</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-7-9">Joseph was also one of our famous ancestors. His brothers were jealous of him and sold him as a slave to be taken to Egypt. But God was with him </span> <span class="text Acts-7-10" id="en-CEV-25048"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup> and rescued him from all his troubles. God made him so wise that the Egyptian king Pharaoh thought highly of him. The king even made Joseph governor over Egypt and put him in charge of everything he owned.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-7-11" id="en-CEV-25049"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup> Everywhere in Egypt and Canaan the grain crops failed. There was terrible suffering, and our ancestors could not find enough to eat. </span> <span class="text Acts-7-12" id="en-CEV-25050"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>But when Jacob heard there was grain in Egypt, he sent our ancestors there for the first time. </span> <span class="text Acts-7-13" id="en-CEV-25051"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup> It was on their second trip that Joseph told his brothers who he was, and the king learned about Joseph's family.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-7-14" id="en-CEV-25052"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup> Joseph sent for his father and his relatives. In all, there were 75 of them. </span> <span class="text Acts-7-15" id="en-CEV-25053"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup> His father went to Egypt and died there, just as our ancestors did. </span> <span class="text Acts-7-16" id="en-CEV-25054"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup> Later their bodies were taken back to Shechem and placed in the tomb that Abraham had bought from the sons of Hamor.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-7-17" id="en-CEV-25055"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup> Finally, the time came for God to do what he had promised Abraham. By then the number of our people in Egypt had greatly increased. </span> <span class="text Acts-7-18" id="en-CEV-25056"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Another king was ruling Egypt, and he didn't know anything about Joseph. </span> <span class="text Acts-7-19" id="en-CEV-25057"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup> He tricked our ancestors and was cruel to them. He even made them leave their babies outside, so they would die.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-7-20" id="en-CEV-25058"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup> During this time Moses was born. He was a very beautiful child, and for three months his parents took care of him in their home. </span> <span class="text Acts-7-21" id="en-CEV-25059"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup> Then when they were forced to leave him outside, the king's daughter found him and raised him as her own son. </span> <span class="text Acts-7-22" id="en-CEV-25060"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Moses was given the best education in Egypt. He was a strong man and a powerful speaker.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-7-23" id="en-CEV-25061"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup> When Moses was 40 years old, he wanted to help the Israelites because they were his own people. </span> <span class="text Acts-7-24" id="en-CEV-25062"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>One day he saw an Egyptian mistreating one of them. So he rescued the man and killed the Egyptian. </span> <span class="text Acts-7-25" id="en-CEV-25063"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Moses thought the rest of his people would realize God was going to use him to set them free. But they didn't understand.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-7-26" id="en-CEV-25064"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>The next day Moses saw two of his own people fighting, and he tried to make them stop. He said, “Men, you are both Israelites. Why are you so cruel to each other?”</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-7-27" id="en-CEV-25065"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>But the man who had started the fight pushed Moses aside and asked, “Who made you our ruler and judge? </span> <span class="text Acts-7-28" id="en-CEV-25066"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>Are you going to kill me, just as you killed that Egyptian yesterday?” </span> <span class="text Acts-7-29" id="en-CEV-25067"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup> When Moses heard this, he ran away to live in the country of Midian. His two sons were born there.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-7-30" id="en-CEV-25068"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup> Forty years later, an angel appeared to Moses from a burning bush in the desert near Mount Sinai. </span> <span class="text Acts-7-31" id="en-CEV-25069"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>Moses was surprised by what he saw. He went closer to get a better look, and the Lord said, </span> <span class="text Acts-7-32" id="en-CEV-25070"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>“I am the God who was worshiped by your ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.” Moses started shaking all over and didn't dare to look at the bush.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-7-33" id="en-CEV-25071"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>The Lord said to him, “Take off your sandals, because the place where you are standing is holy. </span> <span class="text Acts-7-34" id="en-CEV-25072"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>With my own eyes I have seen the suffering of my people in Egypt. I have heard their groans and have come down to rescue them. Now I am sending you back to Egypt.”</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-7-35" id="en-CEV-25073"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup> This was the same Moses that the people rejected by saying, “Who made you our leader and judge?” God's angel had spoken to Moses from the bush. And God had even sent the angel to help Moses rescue the people and be their leader.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-7-36" id="en-CEV-25074"><sup class="versenum">36 </sup> In Egypt and at the Red Sea<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-25074a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-25074a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-25074a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> and in the desert, Moses rescued the people by working miracles and wonders for 40 years. </span> <span class="text Acts-7-37" id="en-CEV-25075"><sup class="versenum">37 </sup> Moses is the one who told the people of Israel, “God will choose one of your people to be a prophet, just as he chose me.” </span> <span class="text Acts-7-38" id="en-CEV-25076"><sup class="versenum">38 </sup> Moses brought our people together in the desert, and the angel spoke to him on Mount Sinai. There he was given these life-giving words to pass on to us. </span> <span class="text Acts-7-39" id="en-CEV-25077"><sup class="versenum">39 </sup>But our ancestors refused to obey Moses. They rejected him and wanted to go back to Egypt.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-7-40" id="en-CEV-25078"><sup class="versenum">40 </sup> The people said to Aaron, “Make some gods to lead us! Moses led us out of Egypt, but we don't know what's happened to him now.” </span> <span class="text Acts-7-41" id="en-CEV-25079"><sup class="versenum">41 </sup> Then they made an idol in the shape of a calf. They offered sacrifices to the idol and were pleased with what they had done.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-7-42" id="en-CEV-25080"><sup class="versenum">42 </sup> God turned his back on his people and left them. Then they worshiped the stars in the sky, just as it says in the Book of the Prophets, “People of Israel, you didn't offer sacrifices and offerings to me during those 40 years in the desert. </span> <span class="text Acts-7-43" id="en-CEV-25081"><sup class="versenum">43 </sup>Instead, you carried the tent where the god Molech is worshiped, and you took along the star of your god Rephan. You made those idols and worshiped them. So now I will have you carried off beyond Babylonia.”</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-7-44" id="en-CEV-25082"><sup class="versenum">44 </sup> The tent where our ancestors worshiped God was with them in the desert. This was the same tent that God had commanded Moses to make. And it was made like the model that Moses had seen. </span> <span class="text Acts-7-45" id="en-CEV-25083"><sup class="versenum">45 </sup> Later it was given to our ancestors, and they took it with them when they went with Joshua. They carried the tent along as they took over the land from those people that God had chased out for them. Our ancestors used this tent until the time of King David. </span> <span class="text Acts-7-46" id="en-CEV-25084"><sup class="versenum">46 </sup> He pleased God and asked him if he could build a house of worship for the people<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-25084b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-25084b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-25084b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> of Israel. </span> <span class="text Acts-7-47" id="en-CEV-25085"><sup class="versenum">47 </sup> And it was finally King Solomon who built a house for God.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-25085c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-25085c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-25085c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup></span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-7-48" id="en-CEV-25086"><sup class="versenum">48 </sup>But the Most High God doesn't live in houses made by humans.
