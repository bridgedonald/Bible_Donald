<h3><span class="text Acts-4-1" id="en-CEV-24947">Peter and John Are Brought in Front of the Council</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Acts-4-1"><span class="chapternum">4 </span>The apostles were still talking to the people, when some priests, the captain of the temple guard, and some Sadducees arrived. </span> <span class="text Acts-4-2" id="en-CEV-24948"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>These men were angry because the apostles were teaching the people that the dead would be raised from death, just as Jesus had been raised from death. </span> <span class="text Acts-4-3" id="en-CEV-24949"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>It was already late in the afternoon, and they arrested Peter and John and put them in jail for the night. </span> <span class="text Acts-4-4" id="en-CEV-24950"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>But a lot of people who had heard the message believed it. So by now there were about 5,000 followers of the Lord.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-4-5" id="en-CEV-24951"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>The next morning the leaders, the elders, and the teachers of the Law of Moses met in Jerusalem. </span> <span class="text Acts-4-6" id="en-CEV-24952"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>The high priest Annas was there, as well as Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and other members of the high priest's family. </span> <span class="text Acts-4-7" id="en-CEV-24953"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>They brought in Peter and John and made them stand in the middle while they questioned them. They asked, “By what power and in whose name have you done this?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-4-8" id="en-CEV-24954"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit and told the nation's leaders and the elders:</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-4-9" id="en-CEV-24955"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>You are questioning us today about a kind deed in which a man who could not walk was healed. </span> <span class="text Acts-4-10" id="en-CEV-24956"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>But there is something we must tell you and everyone else in Israel. This man is standing here completely well because of the power of Jesus Christ from Nazareth. You put Jesus to death on a cross, but God raised him to life. </span> <span class="text Acts-4-11" id="en-CEV-24957"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup> He is the stone you builders thought was worthless, and now he is the most important stone of all. </span> <span class="text Acts-4-12" id="en-CEV-24958"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Only Jesus has the power to save! His name is the only one in all the world that can save anyone.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-4-13" id="en-CEV-24959"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>The officials were amazed to see how brave Peter and John were, and they knew that these two apostles were only ordinary men and not well educated. The officials were certain these men had been with Jesus. </span> <span class="text Acts-4-14" id="en-CEV-24960"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>But they could not deny what had happened. The man who had been healed was standing there with the apostles.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-4-15" id="en-CEV-24961"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>The officials commanded them to leave the council room. Then the officials said to each other, </span> <span class="text Acts-4-16" id="en-CEV-24962"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>“What can we do with these men? Everyone in Jerusalem knows about this miracle, and we cannot say it didn't happen. </span> <span class="text Acts-4-17" id="en-CEV-24963"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>But to keep this thing from spreading, we will warn them never again to speak to anyone about the name of Jesus.” </span> <span class="text Acts-4-18" id="en-CEV-24964"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>So they called the two apostles back in and told them they must never, for any reason, teach anything about the name of Jesus.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-4-19" id="en-CEV-24965"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Peter and John answered, “Do you think God wants us to obey you or to obey him? </span> <span class="text Acts-4-20" id="en-CEV-24966"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>We cannot keep quiet about what we have seen and heard.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-4-21-Acts-4-22" id="en-CEV-24967"><sup class="versenum">21-22 </sup>The officials could not find any reason to punish Peter and John. So they threatened them and let them go. The man who was healed by this miracle was more than 40 years old, and everyone was praising God for what had happened.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Acts-4-23" id="en-CEV-24968">Peter and Others Pray for Courage</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-4-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>As soon as Peter and John had been set free, they went back and told the others everything the chief priests and the leaders had said to them. </span> <span class="text Acts-4-24" id="en-CEV-24969"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup> When the rest of the Lord's followers heard this, they prayed together and said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-4-24">Master, you created heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them. </span> <span class="text Acts-4-25" id="en-CEV-24970"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup> And by the Holy Spirit you spoke to our ancestor David.
