He worshiped God, and so did everyone else who lived in his house. He had given a lot of money to the poor and was always praying to God.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-10-3" id="en-CEV-25182"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>One afternoon at about three o'clock,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-25182a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-25182a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-25182a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> Cornelius had a vision. He saw an angel from God coming to him and calling him by name. </span> <span class="text Acts-10-4" id="en-CEV-25183"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Cornelius was surprised and stared at the angel. Then he asked, “What is this all about?”</span></p><p><span class="text Acts-10-4">The angel answered, “God has heard your prayers and knows about your gifts to the poor. </span> <span class="text Acts-10-5" id="en-CEV-25184"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Now send some men to Joppa for a man named Simon Peter. </span> <span class="text Acts-10-6" id="en-CEV-25185"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>He is staying with Simon the leather maker, who lives in a house near the sea.” </span> <span class="text Acts-10-7" id="en-CEV-25186"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>After saying this, the angel left.</span></p><p><span class="text Acts-10-7">Cornelius called in two of his servants and one of his soldiers who worshiped God. </span> <span class="text Acts-10-8" id="en-CEV-25187"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>He explained everything to them and sent them off to Joppa.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-10-9" id="en-CEV-25188"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup> The next day about noon these men were coming near Joppa.

While the food was being prepared, he fell sound asleep and had a vision. </span> <span class="text Acts-10-11" id="en-CEV-25190"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>He saw heaven open, and something came down like a huge sheet held up by its four corners. </span> <span class="text Acts-10-12" id="en-CEV-25191"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>In it were all kinds of animals, reptiles, and birds. </span> <span class="text Acts-10-13" id="en-CEV-25192"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>A voice said to him, “Peter, get up! Kill these and eat them.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-10-14" id="en-CEV-25193"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup> But Peter said, “Lord, I can't do that!

Why have you come?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-10-22" id="en-CEV-25201"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>They answered, “Captain Cornelius sent us. He is a good man who worships God and is liked by the Jewish people. One of God's holy angels told Cornelius to send for you, so he could hear what you have to say.” </span> <span class="text Acts-10-23" id="en-CEV-25202"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>Peter invited them to spend the night.</span></p><p><span class="text Acts-10-23">The next morning, Peter and some of the Lord's followers in Joppa left with the men who had come from Cornelius. </span> <span class="text Acts-10-24" id="en-CEV-25203"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>The next day they arrived in Caesarea where Cornelius was waiting for them. He had also invited his relatives and close friends.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-10-25" id="en-CEV-25204"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>When Peter arrived, Cornelius greeted him. Then he knelt at Peter's feet and started worshiping him. </span> <span class="text Acts-10-26" id="en-CEV-25205"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>But Peter took hold of him and said, “Stand up! I am nothing more than a human.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-10-27" id="en-CEV-25206"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>As Peter entered the house, he was still talking with Cornelius. Many people were there, </span> <span class="text Acts-10-28" id="en-CEV-25207"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>and Peter said to them, “You know that we Jews are not allowed to have anything to do with other people. But God has shown me that he doesn't think anyone is unclean or unfit. </span> <span class="text Acts-10-29" id="en-CEV-25208"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>I agreed to come here, but I want to know why you sent for me.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-10-30" id="en-CEV-25209"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>Cornelius answered:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-10-30">Four days ago at about three o'clock in the afternoon I was praying at home. Suddenly a man in bright clothes stood in front of me. </span> <span class="text Acts-10-31" id="en-CEV-25210"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>He said, “Cornelius, God has heard your prayers, and he knows about your gifts to the poor. </span> <span class="text Acts-10-32" id="en-CEV-25211"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>Now send to Joppa for Simon Peter.

It all began in Galilee after John had told everyone to be baptized. </span> <span class="text Acts-10-38" id="en-CEV-25217"><sup class="versenum">38 </sup>God gave the Holy Spirit and power to Jesus from Nazareth. He was with Jesus, as he went around doing good and healing everyone who was under the power of the devil. </span> <span class="text Acts-10-39" id="en-CEV-25218"><sup class="versenum">39 </sup>We all saw what Jesus did both in Israel and in the city of Jerusalem.</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-10-39">Jesus was put to death on a cross. </span> <span class="text Acts-10-40" id="en-CEV-25219"><sup class="versenum">40 </sup>But three days later, God raised him to life and let him be seen. </span> <span class="text Acts-10-41" id="en-CEV-25220"><sup class="versenum">41 </sup>Not everyone saw him. He was seen only by us, who ate and drank with him after he was raised from death. We were the ones God chose to tell others about him.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Acts-10-42" id="en-CEV-25221"><sup class="versenum">42 </sup>God told us to announce clearly to the people that Jesus is the one he has chosen to judge the living and the dead. </span> <span class="text Acts-10-43" id="en-CEV-25222"><sup class="versenum">43 </sup>Every one of the prophets has said that all who have faith in Jesus will have their sins forgiven in his name.</span></p> <p><span class="text Acts-10-44" id="en-CEV-25223"><sup class="versenum">44 </sup>While Peter was still speaking, the Holy Spirit took control of everyone who was listening. </span> <span class="text Acts-10-45" id="en-CEV-25224"><sup class="versenum">45 </sup>Some Jewish followers of the Lord had come with Peter, and they were surprised that the Holy Spirit had been given to Gentiles. </span> <span class="text Acts-10-46" id="en-CEV-25225"><sup class="versenum">46 </sup>Now they were hearing Gentiles speaking unknown languages and praising God.</span></p><p><span class="text Acts-10-46">Peter said, </span> <span class="text Acts-10-47" id="en-CEV-25226"><sup class="versenum">47 </sup>“These Gentiles have been given the Holy Spirit, just as we have!
