And when it comes, everything that was ever taken from Jerusalem will be returned and divided among its people. </span> <span class="text Zech-14-2" id="en-CEV-21055"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>But first, he will bring many nations to attack Jerusalem—homes will be robbed, women raped, and half of the population dragged off, though the others will be allowed to remain.</span></p> <p><span class="text Zech-14-3" id="en-CEV-21056"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will attack those nations like a warrior fighting in battle. </span> <span class="text Zech-14-4" id="en-CEV-21057"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>He will take his stand on the Mount of Olives east of Jerusalem, and the mountain will split in half, forming a wide valley that runs from east to west. </span> <span class="text Zech-14-5" id="en-CEV-21058"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Then you people will escape from the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s mountain, through this valley, which reaches to Azal.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-21058a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-21058a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-21058a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> You will run in all directions, just as everyone did when the earthquake struck<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-21058b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-21058b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-21058b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> in the time of King Uzziah of Judah. Afterwards, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> my God will appear with his holy angels.</span></p> <p><span class="text Zech-14-6" id="en-CEV-21059"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>It will be a bright day that won't turn cloudy or cold.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-21059c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-21059c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-21059c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Zech-14-7" id="en-CEV-21060"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>And the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has decided when it will happen—this time of unending day.</span></p> <p><span class="text Zech-14-8" id="en-CEV-21061"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup> In both summer and winter, life-giving streams will flow from Jerusalem, half of them to the Dead Sea in the east and half to the Mediterranean Sea in the west. </span> <span class="text Zech-14-9" id="en-CEV-21062"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Then there will be only one <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> who rules as King and whose name is worshiped everywhere on earth.</span></p> <p><span class="text Zech-14-10-Zech-14-11" id="en-CEV-21063"><sup class="versenum">10-11 </sup> From Geba down to Rimmon<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-21063d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-21063d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-21063d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> south of Jerusalem, the entire country will be turned into flatlands, with Jerusalem still towering above. Then the city will be full of people, from Benjamin Gate, Old Gate Place, and Hananel Tower in the northeast part of the city over to Corner Gate in the northwest and down to King's Wine Press in the south. Jerusalem will always be secure and will never again be destroyed.</span></p> <p><span class="text Zech-14-12" id="en-CEV-21064"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Here is what the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will do to those who attack Jerusalem: While they are standing there, he will make their flesh rot and their eyes fall from their sockets and their tongues drop out. </span> <span class="text Zech-14-13" id="en-CEV-21065"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will make them go into a frenzy and start attacking each other, </span> <span class="text Zech-14-14-Zech-14-15" id="en-CEV-21066"><sup class="versenum">14-15 </sup>until even the people of Judah turn against those in Jerusalem.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-21066e" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-21066e" title="See footnote e"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-21066e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> This same terrible disaster will also strike every animal nearby, including horses, mules, camels, and donkeys.

In fact, every ordinary cooking pot in Jerusalem will be just as sacred to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> All-Powerful as the bowls used at the altar. Any one of them will be acceptable for boiling the meat of sacrificed animals, and there will no longer be a need to sell special pots and bowls.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-21070f" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-21070f" title="See footnote f"&gt;f&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-21070f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup></span></p> <div class="footnotes">
