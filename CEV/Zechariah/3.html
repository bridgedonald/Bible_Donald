This time Joshua the high priest was standing in front of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s angel. And there was Satan, standing at Joshua's right side, ready to accuse him. </span> <span class="text Zech-3-2" id="en-CEV-20906"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup> But the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said, “Satan, you are wrong. Jerusalem is my chosen city, and this man was rescued like a stick from a flaming fire.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Zech-3-3" id="en-CEV-20907"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Joshua's clothes were filthy. </span> <span class="text Zech-3-4" id="en-CEV-20908"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>So the angel told some of the people to remove Joshua's filthy clothes. Then he said to Joshua, “This means you are forgiven. Now I will dress you in priestly clothes.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Zech-3-5" id="en-CEV-20909"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>I spoke up and said, “Also put a clean priestly turban on his head.” Then they dressed him in priestly clothes and put the turban on him, while the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s angel stood there watching.</span></p> <p><span class="text Zech-3-6" id="en-CEV-20910"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>After this, the angel encouraged Joshua by telling him that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> All-Powerful had promised:</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Zech-3-7" id="en-CEV-20911"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>If you truly obey me, I will put you in charge of my temple, including the courtyard around it, and you will be allowed to speak at any time with the angels standing beside me.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-20911a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-20911a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-20911a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Zech-3-8" id="en-CEV-20912"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup> Listen carefully, High Priest Joshua and all of you other priests.
