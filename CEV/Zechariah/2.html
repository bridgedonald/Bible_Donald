<h3><span class="text Zech-2-1" id="en-CEV-20892">Third Vision: A Measuring Line</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Zech-2-1"><span class="chapternum">2 </span>This time I saw someone holding a measuring line, </span> <span class="text Zech-2-2" id="en-CEV-20893"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>and I asked, “Where are you going?”</span></p><p><span class="text Zech-2-2">“To measure Jerusalem,” was the answer. “To find out how wide and long it is.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Zech-2-3" id="en-CEV-20894"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>The angel who had spoken to me came toward me, when another angel came up to him </span> <span class="text Zech-2-4" id="en-CEV-20895"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>and said, “Hurry! Tell that man with the measuring line that Jerusalem won't have any boundaries. It will be too full of people and animals even to have a wall. </span> <span class="text Zech-2-5" id="en-CEV-20896"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> himself has promised to be a protective wall of fire surrounding Jerusalem, and he will be its shining glory in the heart of the city.”</span></p> <h3><span class="text Zech-2-6" id="en-CEV-20897">A Call to Action</span></h3><p><span class="text Zech-2-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> says to his people, “Run! Escape from the land in the north, where I scattered you to the four winds. </span> <span class="text Zech-2-7" id="en-CEV-20898"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Leave Babylonia and hurry back to Zion.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Zech-2-8" id="en-CEV-20899"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Then the glorious <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> All-Powerful ordered me to say to the nations that had raided and robbed Zion:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Zech-2-8">Zion is as precious to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> as are his eyes. Whatever you do to Zion, you do to him. </span> <span class="text Zech-2-9" id="en-CEV-20900"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>And so, he will put you in the power of your slaves, and they will raid and rob you.
