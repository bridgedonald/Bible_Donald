We are your servants. Please tell us your dream, and we will explain what it means.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Dan-2-5" id="en-CEV-19782"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>But the king replied, “No! I have made up my mind. If you don't tell me both the dream and its meaning, you will be chopped to pieces and your houses will be torn down. </span> <span class="text Dan-2-6" id="en-CEV-19783"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>However, if you do tell me both the dream and its meaning, you will be greatly rewarded and highly honored. Now tell me the dream and explain what it means.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Dan-2-7" id="en-CEV-19784"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>“Your Majesty,” they said, “if you will only tell us your dream, we will interpret it for you.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Dan-2-8" id="en-CEV-19785"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>The king replied, “You're just stalling for time, </span> <span class="text Dan-2-9" id="en-CEV-19786"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>because you know what's going to happen if you don't come up with the answer. You've decided to make up a bunch of lies, hoping I might change my mind. Now tell me the dream, and that will prove that you can interpret it.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Dan-2-10" id="en-CEV-19787"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>His advisors explained, “Your Majesty, you are demanding the impossible! No king, not even the most famous and powerful, has ever ordered his advisors, magicians, or wise men to do such a thing. </span> <span class="text Dan-2-11" id="en-CEV-19788"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>It can't be done, except by the gods, and they don't live here on earth.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Dan-2-12-Dan-2-13" id="en-CEV-19789"><sup class="versenum">12-13 </sup>This made the king so angry that he gave orders for every wise man in Babylonia to be put to death, including Daniel and his three friends.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Dan-2-14" id="en-CEV-19790">God Tells Nebuchadnezzar's Dream to Daniel</span></h3><p><span class="text Dan-2-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Arioch was the king's official in charge of putting the wise men to death.
