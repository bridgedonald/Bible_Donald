<h3><span class="text Dan-6-1" id="en-CEV-19913">Daniel in a Pit of Lions</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Dan-6-1"><span class="chapternum">6 </span>Darius divided his kingdom into 120 states and placed a governor in charge of each one. </span> <span class="text Dan-6-2" id="en-CEV-19914"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>In order to make sure that his government was run properly, Darius put three other officials in charge of the governors. One of these officials was Daniel. </span> <span class="text Dan-6-3" id="en-CEV-19915"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>And he did his work so much better than the other governors and officials that the king decided to let him govern the whole kingdom.</span></p> <p><span class="text Dan-6-4" id="en-CEV-19916"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>The other men tried to find something wrong with the way Daniel did his work for the king. But they could not accuse him of anything wrong, because he was honest and faithful and did everything he was supposed to do. </span> <span class="text Dan-6-5" id="en-CEV-19917"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Finally, they said to one another, “We will never be able to bring any charge against Daniel, unless it has to do with his religion.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Dan-6-6" id="en-CEV-19918"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>They all went to the king and said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Dan-6-6">“Your Majesty, we hope you live forever! </span> <span class="text Dan-6-7" id="en-CEV-19919"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup> All of your officials, leaders, advisors, and governors agree that you should make a law forbidding anyone to pray to any god or human except you for the next 30 days. Everyone who disobeys this law must be thrown into a pit of lions. </span> <span class="text Dan-6-8" id="en-CEV-19920"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Order this to be written and then sign it, so it cannot be changed, just as no written law of the Medes and Persians can be changed.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Dan-6-9" id="en-CEV-19921"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>So King Darius made the law and had it written down.</span></p> <p><span class="text Dan-6-10" id="en-CEV-19922"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Daniel heard about the law, but when he returned home, he went upstairs and prayed in front of the window that faced Jerusalem. In the same way that he had always done, he knelt down in prayer three times a day, giving thanks to God.</span></p> <p><span class="text Dan-6-11" id="en-CEV-19923"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>The men who had spoken to the king watched Daniel and saw him praying to his God for help. </span> <span class="text Dan-6-12" id="en-CEV-19924"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>They went back to the king and said, “Didn't you make a law that forbids anyone to pray to any god or human except you for the next 30 days? And doesn't the law say that everyone who disobeys it will be thrown into a pit of lions?”</span></p><p><span class="text Dan-6-12">“Yes, that's the law I made,” the king agreed. “And just like all written laws of the Medes and Persians, it cannot be changed.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Dan-6-13" id="en-CEV-19925"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>The men then told the king, “That Jew named Daniel, who was brought here as a captive, refuses to obey you or the law that you ordered to be written. And he still prays to his god three times a day.” </span> <span class="text Dan-6-14" id="en-CEV-19926"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>The king was really upset to hear about this, and for the rest of the day he tried to think how he could save Daniel.</span></p> <p><span class="text Dan-6-15" id="en-CEV-19927"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>At sunset the men returned and said, “Your Majesty, remember that no written law of the Medes and Persians can be changed, not even by the king.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Dan-6-16" id="en-CEV-19928"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup> So Darius ordered Daniel to be brought out and thrown into a pit of lions. But he said to Daniel, “You have been faithful to your God, and I pray that he will rescue you.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Dan-6-17" id="en-CEV-19929"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>A stone was rolled over the pit, and it was sealed. Then Darius and his officials stamped the seal to show that no one should let Daniel out. </span> <span class="text Dan-6-18" id="en-CEV-19930"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>All night long the king could not sleep. He did not eat anything, and he would not let anyone come in to entertain him.</span></p> <p><span class="text Dan-6-19" id="en-CEV-19931"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>At daybreak the king got up and ran to the pit. </span> <span class="text Dan-6-20" id="en-CEV-19932"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>He was anxious and shouted, “Daniel, you were faithful and served your God. Was he able to save you from the lions?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Dan-6-21" id="en-CEV-19933"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Daniel answered, “Your Majesty, I hope you live forever! </span> <span class="text Dan-6-22" id="en-CEV-19934"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup> My God knew that I was innocent, and he sent an angel to keep the lions from eating me. Your Majesty, I have never done anything to hurt you.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Dan-6-23" id="en-CEV-19935"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>The king was relieved to hear Daniel's voice, and he gave orders for him to be taken out of the pit. Daniel's faith in his God had kept him from being harmed. </span> <span class="text Dan-6-24" id="en-CEV-19936"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>And the king ordered the men who had brought charges against Daniel to be thrown into the pit, together with their wives and children. But before they even reached the bottom, the lions ripped them to pieces.</span></p> <p><span class="text Dan-6-25" id="en-CEV-19937"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>King Darius then sent this message to all people of every nation and race in the world:</span></p><div class="poetry"><p class="line"><span class="text Dan-6-25">“Greetings to all of you!</span><br/><span class="text Dan-6-26" id="en-CEV-19938"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>I command everyone</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Dan-6-26">in my kingdom</span></span><br/><span class="text Dan-6-26">to worship and honor</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Dan-6-26">the God of Daniel.</span></span><br/><span class="text Dan-6-26">He is the living God,</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Dan-6-26">the one who lives forever.</span></span><br/><span class="text Dan-6-26">His power and his kingdom</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Dan-6-26">will never end.</span></span><br/><span class="text Dan-6-27" id="en-CEV-19939"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>He rescues people</span><br/><span class="text Dan-6-27">and sets them free</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Dan-6-27">by working great miracles.</span></span><br/><span class="text Dan-6-27">Daniel's God has rescued him</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Dan-6-27">from the power of the lions.”</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1"><span class="text Dan-6-28" id="en-CEV-19940"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>All went well for Daniel while Darius was king, and even when Cyrus the Persian ruled.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-19940a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-19940a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-19940a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></span></p> <div class="footnotes">
