Four kings will rule Persia, one after the other, but the fourth one will become much richer than the others. In fact, his wealth will make him so powerful that he will turn everyone against the kingdom of Greece. </span> <span class="text Dan-11-3" id="en-CEV-20041"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Then a mighty king will come to power and will be able to do whatever he pleases. </span> <span class="text Dan-11-4" id="en-CEV-20042"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>But suddenly his kingdom will be crushed and scattered to the four corners of the earth, where four more kingdoms will rise.
