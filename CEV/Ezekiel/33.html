They have lost all hope for survival, and they blame me. </span> <span class="text Ezek-33-11" id="en-CEV-19348"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Tell them that as surely as I am the living <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God, I don't like to see wicked people die. I enjoy seeing them turn from their sins and live. So if the Israelites want to live, they must stop sinning and turn back to me.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-33-12" id="en-CEV-19349"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Tell them that when good people start sinning, all the good they did in the past cannot save them from being punished.

Their good deeds will be forgotten.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-33-14" id="en-CEV-19351"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Suppose I warn wicked people that they will die because of their sins, and they stop sinning and start doing right. </span> <span class="text Ezek-33-15" id="en-CEV-19352"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>For example, they need to return anything they have taken as security for a loan and anything they have stolen.

But they are the ones who are unfair. </span> <span class="text Ezek-33-18" id="en-CEV-19355"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>If good people start doing evil, they will be put to death, because they have sinned. </span> <span class="text Ezek-33-19" id="en-CEV-19356"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>And if wicked people stop sinning and start doing right, they will save themselves from punishment. </span> <span class="text Ezek-33-20" id="en-CEV-19357"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>But the Israelites still think I am unfair.

There are many of us, and so this land must be ours.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-33-25" id="en-CEV-19362"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>So, Ezekiel, tell them I am saying:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezek-33-25">How can you think the land is still yours? You eat meat with blood in it and worship idols. You commit murder </span> <span class="text Ezek-33-26" id="en-CEV-19363"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>and spread violence throughout the land. Everything you do is wicked; you are even unfaithful in marriage. And you claim the land is yours!</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezek-33-27" id="en-CEV-19364"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>As surely as I am the living <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God, you people in the ruined cities will be killed in battle. Those of you living in the countryside will be eaten by wild animals, and those hiding in caves and on rocky cliffs will die from deadly diseases. </span> <span class="text Ezek-33-28" id="en-CEV-19365"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>I will make the whole country an empty wasteland and crush the power in which you take such pride. Even the mountains will be bare, and no one will try to cross them. </span> <span class="text Ezek-33-29" id="en-CEV-19366"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>I will punish you because of your sins, and I will turn your nation into a barren desert.
