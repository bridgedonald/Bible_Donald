<h3><span class="text Ezek-20-1" id="en-CEV-18960">Israel Keeps On Rebelling</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Ezek-20-1"><span class="chapternum">20 </span>Seven years after King Jehoiachin and the rest of us had been led away as prisoners to Babylonia, some of Israel's leaders came to me on the tenth day of the fifth month.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-18960a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-18960a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-18960a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> They sat down and asked for a message from the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>. </span> <span class="text Ezek-20-2" id="en-CEV-18961"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Just then, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God said:</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-20-3" id="en-CEV-18962"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Ezekiel, son of man, these leaders have come to find out what I want them to do. As surely as I live, I will not give them an answer of any kind.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-20-4" id="en-CEV-18963"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Are you willing to warn them, Ezekiel? Then remind them of the disgusting sins of their ancestors.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-20-5" id="en-CEV-18964"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup> Tell them that long ago I, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God, chose Israel to be my own. I appeared to their ancestors in Egypt and made a solemn promise that I would be their God and the God of their descendants. </span> <span class="text Ezek-20-6" id="en-CEV-18965"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>I swore that I would rescue them from Egypt and lead them to a land I had already chosen. This land was rich with milk and honey and was the most splendid land of all. </span> <span class="text Ezek-20-7" id="en-CEV-18966"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>I told them to get rid of their disgusting idols and not to sin by worshiping the gods of Egypt. I reminded them that I was the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> their God, </span> <span class="text Ezek-20-8" id="en-CEV-18967"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>but they still rebelled against me. They refused to listen and kept on worshiping their idols and foreign gods.</span></p><p><span class="text Ezek-20-8">In my anger, I decided to punish the Israelites in Egypt. </span> <span class="text Ezek-20-9" id="en-CEV-18968"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>But that would have made me look like a liar, because I had already promised in front of everyone that I would lead them out of Egypt. </span> <span class="text Ezek-20-10" id="en-CEV-18969"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>So I brought them out and led them into the desert. </span> <span class="text Ezek-20-11" id="en-CEV-18970"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup> I gave them my laws and teachings, so they would know how to live right. </span> <span class="text Ezek-20-12" id="en-CEV-18971"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup> And I commanded them to respect the Sabbath as a way of showing that they were holy and belonged to me. </span> <span class="text Ezek-20-13" id="en-CEV-18972"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>But the Israelites rebelled against me in the desert. They refused to obey my laws and teachings, and they treated the Sabbath like any other day.</span></p><p><span class="text Ezek-20-13">Then in my anger, I decided to destroy the Israelites in the desert once and for all. </span> <span class="text Ezek-20-14" id="en-CEV-18973"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>But that would have disgraced me, because many other nations had seen me bring the Israelites out of Egypt. </span> <span class="text Ezek-20-15" id="en-CEV-18974"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup> Instead, I told them in the desert that I would not lead them into the beautiful, fertile land I had promised. </span> <span class="text Ezek-20-16" id="en-CEV-18975"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>I said this because they had not only ignored my laws and teachings, but had disgraced my Sabbath and worshiped idols.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-20-17" id="en-CEV-18976"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Yet, I felt sorry for them and could not let them die in the desert. </span> <span class="text Ezek-20-18" id="en-CEV-18977"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>So I warned the children not to act like their parents or follow their evil ways or worship their idols. </span> <span class="text Ezek-20-19" id="en-CEV-18978"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>I reminded them that I was the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> their God and that they should obey my laws and teachings. </span> <span class="text Ezek-20-20" id="en-CEV-18979"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>I told them to respect my Sabbath to show that they were my people and that I was the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> their God. </span> <span class="text Ezek-20-21" id="en-CEV-18980"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>But the children also rebelled against me. They refused to obey my laws and teachings, and they treated the Sabbath as any other day.</span></p><p><span class="text Ezek-20-21">I became angry and decided to punish them in the desert. </span> <span class="text Ezek-20-22" id="en-CEV-18981"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>But I did not. That would have disgraced me in front of the nations that had seen me bring the Israelites out of Egypt. </span> <span class="text Ezek-20-23" id="en-CEV-18982"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup> So I solemnly swore that I would scatter the people of Israel across the nations, </span> <span class="text Ezek-20-24" id="en-CEV-18983"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>because they had disobeyed my laws and ignored my teachings; they had disgraced my Sabbath and worshiped the idols their ancestors had made. </span> <span class="text Ezek-20-25" id="en-CEV-18984"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>I gave them laws that bring punishment instead of life, </span> <span class="text Ezek-20-26" id="en-CEV-18985"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>and I let them offer me unacceptable sacrifices, including their first-born sons. I did this to horrify them and to let them know that I, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, was punishing them.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-20-27" id="en-CEV-18986"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>Ezekiel, tell the people of Israel that their ancestors also rejected and insulted me </span> <span class="text Ezek-20-28" id="en-CEV-18987"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>by offering sacrifices, incense, and wine to gods on every hill and under every large tree. I was very angry, because they did these things in the land I had given them! </span> <span class="text Ezek-20-29" id="en-CEV-18988"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>I asked them where they went to worship those gods, and they answered, “At the local shrines.”<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-18988b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-18988b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-18988b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> And those places of worship are still called shrines.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-20-30" id="en-CEV-18989"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>Then ask the Israelites why they are following the example of their wicked ancestors </span> <span class="text Ezek-20-31" id="en-CEV-18990"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>by worshiping idols and by sacrificing their own children as offerings. They commit these sins and still think they can ask me for a message.
