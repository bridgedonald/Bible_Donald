<h3><span class="text Ezek-10-1" id="en-CEV-18702">The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s Glory Leaves the Temple</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Ezek-10-1"><span class="chapternum">10 </span> I saw the dome that was above the four winged creatures,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-18702a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-18702a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-18702a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> and on it was the sapphire<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-18702b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-18702b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-18702b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> throne.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-18702c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-18702c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-18702c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Ezek-10-2" id="en-CEV-18703"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup> The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to the man in the linen robe, “Walk among the four wheels beside the creatures and pick up as many hot coals as you can carry. Then scatter them over the city of Jerusalem.” I watched him as he followed the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s instructions.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-10-3" id="en-CEV-18704"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>The winged creatures were standing south of the temple when the man walked among them. A cloud filled the inner courtyard, </span> <span class="text Ezek-10-4" id="en-CEV-18705"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>and the brightness of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s glory moved from above the creatures and stopped at the entrance of the temple. The entire temple was filled with his glory, and the courtyard was dazzling bright. </span> <span class="text Ezek-10-5" id="en-CEV-18706"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>The sound of the creatures' wings was as loud as the voice of God All-Powerful and could even be heard in the outer courtyard.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-10-6" id="en-CEV-18707"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>The man in the robe was now standing beside a wheel. </span> <span class="text Ezek-10-7" id="en-CEV-18708"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>One of the four creatures reached its hand into the fire among them and gave him some of the hot coals. The man took the coals and left.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-10-8" id="en-CEV-18709"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>I noticed again that each of the four winged creatures had what looked like human hands under their wings, </span> <span class="text Ezek-10-9" id="en-CEV-18710"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup> and I saw the four wheels near the creatures. These wheels were shining like chrysolite.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-18710d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-18710d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-18710d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Ezek-10-10" id="en-CEV-18711"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Each wheel was exactly the same and had a second wheel that cut through the middle of it,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-18711e" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-18711e" title="See footnote e"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-18711e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Ezek-10-11" id="en-CEV-18712"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>so that they could move in any direction without turning. The wheels moved together whenever the creatures moved. </span> <span class="text Ezek-10-12" id="en-CEV-18713"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup> I also noticed that the wheels and the creatures' bodies, including their backs, their hands, and their wings, were covered with eyes. </span> <span class="text Ezek-10-13" id="en-CEV-18714"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>And I heard a voice calling these “the wheels that spin.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-10-14" id="en-CEV-18715"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup> Each of the winged creatures had four faces: the face of a bull,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-18715f" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-18715f" title="See footnote f"&gt;f&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-18715f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> the face of a human, the face of a lion, and the face of an eagle. </span> <span class="text Ezek-10-15-Ezek-10-17" id="en-CEV-18716"><sup class="versenum">15-17 </sup>These were the same creatures I had seen near the Chebar River. They controlled when and where the wheels moved—the wheels went wherever the creatures went and stopped whenever they stopped. Even when the creatures flew in the air, the wheels stayed beside them.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-10-18" id="en-CEV-18717"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Then I watched the brightness of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s glory move from the entrance of the temple and stop above the winged creatures. </span> <span class="text Ezek-10-19" id="en-CEV-18718"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>They spread their wings and flew into the air with the wheels at their side. They stopped at the east gate of the temple, and the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s glory was above them.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-10-20" id="en-CEV-18719"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>I knew for sure that these were the same creatures I had seen beneath the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s glory near the Chebar River. </span> <span class="text Ezek-10-21-Ezek-10-22" id="en-CEV-18720"><sup class="versenum">21-22 </sup>They had four wings with hands beneath them, and they had the same four faces as those near the River. Each creature moved straight ahead without turning.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
