Your towns may now lie in ruins, and nations may laugh and insult you. </span> <span class="text Ezek-36-5" id="en-CEV-19419"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>But in my fierce anger, I will turn against those nations, and especially the Edomites, because they laughed at you the loudest and took over your pasturelands. </span> <span class="text Ezek-36-6" id="en-CEV-19420"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>You have suffered long enough, and, I, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God, am very angry! Nations have insulted you, </span> <span class="text Ezek-36-7" id="en-CEV-19421"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>so I will now insult and disgrace them. That is my solemn promise.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-36-8" id="en-CEV-19422"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Trees will grow on you mountains of Israel and produce fruit for my people, because they will soon come home. </span> <span class="text Ezek-36-9" id="en-CEV-19423"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>I will take care of you by plowing your soil and planting crops on your fertile slopes. </span> <span class="text Ezek-36-10" id="en-CEV-19424"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>The people of Israel will return and rebuild your ruined towns and live in them. </span> <span class="text Ezek-36-11" id="en-CEV-19425"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Children will be born, and animals will give birth to their young. You will no longer be deserted as you are now, but you will be covered with people and treated better than ever. Then you will know that I am the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-36-12" id="en-CEV-19426"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>I will bring my people Israel home, and they will live on you mountains, because you belong to them, and your fertile slopes will never again let them starve. </span> <span class="text Ezek-36-13" id="en-CEV-19427"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>It's true that you have been accused of not producing enough food and of letting your people starve. </span> <span class="text Ezek-36-14-Ezek-36-15" id="en-CEV-19428"><sup class="versenum">14-15 </sup>But I, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, promise that you won't hear other nations laugh and sneer at you ever again. From now on, you will always produce plenty of food for your people. I, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God, have spoken.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Ezek-36-16" id="en-CEV-19429">The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> Will Be Honored</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-36-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said:</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-36-17" id="en-CEV-19430"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Ezekiel, son of man, when the people of Israel were living in their own country, they made the land unclean by the way they behaved, just as a woman's monthly period makes her unclean. </span> <span class="text Ezek-36-18" id="en-CEV-19431"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>They committed murders and worshiped idols, which made the land even worse. So in my anger, I punished my people </span> <span class="text Ezek-36-19" id="en-CEV-19432"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>and scattered them throughout the nations, just as they deserved. </span> <span class="text Ezek-36-20" id="en-CEV-19433"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Wherever they went, my name was disgraced, because foreigners insulted my people by saying I had forced them out of their own land.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-36-21" id="en-CEV-19434"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>I care what those foreigners think of me, </span> <span class="text Ezek-36-22" id="en-CEV-19435"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>so tell the Israelites that I am saying:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezek-36-22">You have disgraced my holy name among the nations where you now live. So you don't deserve what I'm going to do for you. I will lead you home to bring honor to my name </span> <span class="text Ezek-36-23" id="en-CEV-19436"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>and to show foreign nations that I am holy. Then they will know that I am the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God. I have spoken.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezek-36-24" id="en-CEV-19437"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>I will gather you from the foreign nations and bring you home. </span> <span class="text Ezek-36-25" id="en-CEV-19438"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>I will sprinkle you with clean water, and you will be clean and acceptable to me. I will wash away everything that makes you unclean, and I will remove your disgusting idols. </span> <span class="text Ezek-36-26" id="en-CEV-19439"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup> I will take away your stubborn heart and give you a new heart and a desire to be faithful. You will have only pure thoughts, </span> <span class="text Ezek-36-27" id="en-CEV-19440"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>because I will put my Spirit in you and make you eager to obey my laws and teachings. </span> <span class="text Ezek-36-28" id="en-CEV-19441"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>You will once again live in the land I gave your ancestors; you will be my people, and I will be your God.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezek-36-29" id="en-CEV-19442"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>I will protect you from anything that makes you unclean. Your fields will overflow with grain, and no one will starve. </span> <span class="text Ezek-36-30" id="en-CEV-19443"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>Your trees will be filled with fruit, and crops will grow in your fields, so that you will never again feel ashamed for not having enough food. </span> <span class="text Ezek-36-31" id="en-CEV-19444"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>You will remember your evil ways and hate yourselves for what you've done. </span> <span class="text Ezek-36-32" id="en-CEV-19445"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>People of Israel, I'm not doing these things for your sake. You sinned against me, and you must suffer shame and disgrace for what you have done. I, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God, have spoken.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezek-36-33" id="en-CEV-19446"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>After I have made you clean, I will let you rebuild your ruined towns and let you live in them. </span> <span class="text Ezek-36-34" id="en-CEV-19447"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>Your land will be plowed again, and nobody will be able to see that it was once barren. </span> <span class="text Ezek-36-35" id="en-CEV-19448"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>Instead, they will say that it looks as beautiful as the garden of Eden. They won't see towns lying in ruins, but they will see your strong cities filled with people. </span> <span class="text Ezek-36-36" id="en-CEV-19449"><sup class="versenum">36 </sup>Then the nearby nations that survive will know that I am the one who rebuilt the ruined places and replanted the barren fields. I, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, make this promise.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezek-36-37" id="en-CEV-19450"><sup class="versenum">37 </sup>I will once again answer your prayers, and I will let your nation grow until you are like a large flock of sheep. </span> <span class="text Ezek-36-38" id="en-CEV-19451"><sup class="versenum">38 </sup>The towns that now lie in ruins will be filled with people, just as Jerusalem was once filled with sheep to be offered as sacrifices during a festival. Then you will know that I am the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>.</span></p>  <!--end of crossrefs-->
