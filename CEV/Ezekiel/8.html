<h3><span class="text Ezek-8-1" id="en-CEV-18674">Ezekiel Sees the Terrible Sins of Jerusalem</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Ezek-8-1"><span class="chapternum">8 </span>Six years after King Jehoiachin and the rest of us had been led away as prisoners to Babylonia, the leaders of Judah were meeting with me in my house. On the fifth day of the sixth month,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-18674a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-18674a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-18674a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God suddenly took control of me, </span> <span class="text Ezek-8-2" id="en-CEV-18675"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup> and I saw something in the shape of a human.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-18675b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-18675b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-18675b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> This figure was like fire from the waist down, and it was bright as polished metal from the waist up. </span> <span class="text Ezek-8-3" id="en-CEV-18676"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>It reached out what seemed to be a hand and grabbed my hair. Then in my vision the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s Spirit lifted me into the sky and carried me to Jerusalem.</span></p><p><span class="text Ezek-8-3">The Spirit took me to the north gate of the temple's inner courtyard, where there was an idol that disgusted the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> and made him furious. </span> <span class="text Ezek-8-4" id="en-CEV-18677"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup> Then I saw the brightness of the glory of the God of Israel, just as I had seen it near the Chebar River.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-8-5" id="en-CEV-18678"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>God said to me, “Ezekiel, son of man, look north.” And when I did, I saw that repulsive idol by the altar near the gate.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-8-6" id="en-CEV-18679"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>God then said, “Do you see the terrible sins of the people of Israel? Their sins are making my holy temple unfit as a place to worship me. Yet you will see even worse things than this.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-8-7" id="en-CEV-18680"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Next, I was taken to the entrance of the courtyard, where I saw a hole in the wall.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-8-8" id="en-CEV-18681"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>God said, “Make this hole bigger.” And when I did, I realized it was a doorway. </span> <span class="text Ezek-8-9" id="en-CEV-18682"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>“Go in,” God said, “and see what horrible and evil things the people are doing.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-8-10" id="en-CEV-18683"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Inside, I saw that the walls were covered with pictures of reptiles and disgusting, unclean animals,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-18683c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-18683c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-18683c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> as well as with idols that the Israelites were worshiping. </span> <span class="text Ezek-8-11" id="en-CEV-18684"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Seventy Israelite leaders were standing there, including Jaazaniah son of Shaphan. Each of these leaders was holding an incense burner, and the smell of incense filled the room.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-8-12" id="en-CEV-18685"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>God said, “Ezekiel, do you see what horrible things Israel's leaders are doing in secret? They have filled their rooms with idols. And they say I can't see them, because they think I have already deserted Israel. </span> <span class="text Ezek-8-13" id="en-CEV-18686"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>But I will show you something even worse than this.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-8-14" id="en-CEV-18687"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>He took me to the north gate of the temple, where I saw women mourning for the god Tammuz.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-18687d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-18687d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-18687d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Ezek-8-15" id="en-CEV-18688"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>God asked me, “Can you believe what these women are doing? But now I want to show you something even worse.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-8-16" id="en-CEV-18689"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>I was then led into the temple's inner courtyard, where I saw about 25 men standing near the entrance, between the porch and the altar. Their backs were to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s temple, and they were bowing down to the rising sun.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-8-17" id="en-CEV-18690"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>God said, “Ezekiel, it's bad enough that the people of Judah are doing these disgusting things. But they have also spread violence and injustice everywhere in Israel and have made me very angry. They have disgraced and insulted me in the worst possible way.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-18690e" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-18690e" title="See footnote e"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-18690e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Ezek-8-18" id="en-CEV-18691"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>So in my fierce anger, I will punish them without mercy and refuse to help them when they cry out to me.”</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
