<h3><span class="text Ezek-12-1" id="en-CEV-18746">Ezekiel Acts Out Israel's Captivity</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Ezek-12-1"><span class="chapternum">12 </span>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said:</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezek-12-2" id="en-CEV-18747"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup> Ezekiel, son of man, you are living among rebellious people. They have eyes, but refuse to see; they have ears, but refuse to listen. </span> <span class="text Ezek-12-3" id="en-CEV-18748"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>So before it gets dark, here is what I want you to do. Pack a few things as though you were going to be taken away as a prisoner. Then go outside where everyone can see you and walk around from place to place. Maybe as they watch, they will realize what rebels they are. </span> <span class="text Ezek-12-4" id="en-CEV-18749"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>After you have done this, return to your house.</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezek-12-4">Later that evening leave your house as if you were going into exile. </span> <span class="text Ezek-12-5" id="en-CEV-18750"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Dig through the wall of your house<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-18750a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-18750a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-18750a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> and crawl out, carrying the bag with you. Make sure everyone is watching. </span> <span class="text Ezek-12-6" id="en-CEV-18751"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Lift the bag to your shoulders, and with your face covered, take it into the darkness, so that you cannot see the land you are leaving. All this will be a warning for the people of Israel.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-12-7" id="en-CEV-18752"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>I did everything the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had said. I packed a few things. Then as the sun was going down, and while everyone was watching, I dug a hole through one of the walls of my house. I pulled out my bag, then lifted it to my shoulders and left in the darkness.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-12-8" id="en-CEV-18753"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>The next morning, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> </span> <span class="text Ezek-12-9" id="en-CEV-18754"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>reminded me that those rebellious people didn't even ask what I was doing. </span> <span class="text Ezek-12-10" id="en-CEV-18755"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>So he sent me back to tell them:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezek-12-10">The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God has a message for the leader of Jerusalem and everyone living there!</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezek-12-11" id="en-CEV-18756"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>I have done these things to show them what will happen when they are taken away as prisoners.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezek-12-12" id="en-CEV-18757"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>The leader of Jerusalem will lift his own bag to his shoulders at sunset and leave through a hole that the others have dug in the wall of his house. He will cover his face, so he can't see the land he is leaving. </span> <span class="text Ezek-12-13" id="en-CEV-18758"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup> The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will spread out a net and trap him as he leaves Jerusalem. He will then be led away to the city of Babylon, but will never see that place,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-18758b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-18758b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-18758b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> even though he will die there. </span> <span class="text Ezek-12-14" id="en-CEV-18759"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>His own officials and troops will scatter in every direction, and the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will track them down and put them to death.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezek-12-15" id="en-CEV-18760"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will force the rest of the people in Jerusalem to live in foreign nations, where they will realize that he has done all these things. </span> <span class="text Ezek-12-16" id="en-CEV-18761"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Some of them will survive the war, the starvation, and the deadly diseases. That way, they will be able to tell foreigners how disgusting their sins were, and that it was the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> who punished them in this way.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Ezek-12-17" id="en-CEV-18762">A Sign of Fear</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-12-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said:</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-12-18" id="en-CEV-18763"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Ezekiel, son of man, shake with fear when you eat, and tremble when you drink. </span> <span class="text Ezek-12-19" id="en-CEV-18764"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Tell the people of Israel that I, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, say that someday everyone in Jerusalem will shake when they eat and tremble when they drink. Their country will be destroyed and left empty, because they have been cruel and violent. </span> <span class="text Ezek-12-20" id="en-CEV-18765"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Every town will lie in ruins, and the land will be a barren desert. Then they will know that I am the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Ezek-12-21" id="en-CEV-18766">The Words of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> Will Come True</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-12-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said:</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-12-22" id="en-CEV-18767"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Ezekiel, son of man, you've heard people in Israel use the saying, “Time passes, and prophets are proved wrong.” </span> <span class="text Ezek-12-23" id="en-CEV-18768"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>Now tell the people that I, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, am going to prove that saying wrong. No one will ever be able to use it again in Israel, because very soon everything I have said will come true! </span> <span class="text Ezek-12-24" id="en-CEV-18769"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>The people will hear no more useless warnings and false messages. </span> <span class="text Ezek-12-25" id="en-CEV-18770"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>I will give them my message, and what I say will certainly happen. Warn those rebels that the time has come for them to be punished. I, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, make this promise.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-12-26-Ezek-12-27" id="en-CEV-18771"><sup class="versenum">26-27 </sup>Ezekiel, the people of Israel are also saying that your visions and messages are only about things in the future. </span> <span class="text Ezek-12-28" id="en-CEV-18772"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>So tell them that my words will soon come true, just as I have warned. I, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, have spoken.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
