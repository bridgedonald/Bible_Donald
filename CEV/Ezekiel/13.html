Tell them it's time to hear my message.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-13-3" id="en-CEV-18775"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>I, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God, say those lying prophets are doomed! They don't see visions—they make up their own messages! </span> <span class="text Ezek-13-4" id="en-CEV-18776"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Israel's prophets are no better than jackals<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-18776a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-18776a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-18776a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> that hunt for food among the ruins of a city. </span> <span class="text Ezek-13-5" id="en-CEV-18777"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>They don't warn the people about coming trouble or tell them how dangerous it is to sin against me. </span> <span class="text Ezek-13-6" id="en-CEV-18778"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Those prophets lie by claiming they speak for me, but I have not even chosen them to be my prophets. And they still think their words will come true. </span> <span class="text Ezek-13-7" id="en-CEV-18779"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>They say they're preaching my messages, but they are full of lies—I did not speak to them!</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-13-8" id="en-CEV-18780"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>So I am going to punish those lying prophets for deceiving the people of Israel with false messages. </span> <span class="text Ezek-13-9" id="en-CEV-18781"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>I will turn against them and no longer let them belong to my people.

They tell my people there will be peace, even though there's no peace to be found. They are like workers who think they can fix a shaky wall by covering it with paint. </span> <span class="text Ezek-13-11" id="en-CEV-18783"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>But when I send rainstorms, hailstones, and strong winds, the wall will surely collapse. </span> <span class="text Ezek-13-12" id="en-CEV-18784"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>People will then ask the workers why the paint didn't hold it up.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-13-13" id="en-CEV-18785"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>That wall is the city of Jerusalem. And I, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God, am so angry that I will send strong winds, rainstorms, and hailstones to destroy it. </span> <span class="text Ezek-13-14" id="en-CEV-18786"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>The lying prophets have tried to cover up the evil in Jerusalem, but I will tear down the city, all the way to its foundations. And when it collapses, those prophets will be killed, and everyone will know that I have done these things.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-13-15" id="en-CEV-18787"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>The city of Jerusalem and its lying prophets will feel my fierce anger. Then I will announce that the city has fallen and that the lying prophets are dead, </span> <span class="text Ezek-13-16" id="en-CEV-18788"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>because they promised my people peace, when there was no peace.
