Never in my life have I eaten food that would make me unacceptable to you. I've never eaten anything that died a natural death or was killed by a wild animal or that you said was unclean.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-4-15" id="en-CEV-18613"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> replied, “Instead of human waste, I will let you bake your bread on a fire made from cow manure. </span> <span class="text Ezek-4-16" id="en-CEV-18614"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Ezekiel, the people of Jerusalem will starve.
