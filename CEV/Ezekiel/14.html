<h3><span class="text Ezek-14-1" id="en-CEV-18796">Ezekiel Encourages the People To Turn Back to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Ezek-14-1"><span class="chapternum">14 </span>One day, some of Israel's leaders came to me and asked for a message from the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>. </span> <span class="text Ezek-14-2" id="en-CEV-18797"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>While they were there, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said:</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-14-3" id="en-CEV-18798"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Ezekiel, son of man, these men have started worshiping idols, though they know it will cause them to sin even more. So I refuse to give them a message!</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-14-4" id="en-CEV-18799"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Tell the people of Israel that if they sin by worshiping idols and then go to a prophet to find out what I say, I will give them the answer their sins deserve. </span> <span class="text Ezek-14-5" id="en-CEV-18800"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>When they hear my message, maybe they will see that they need to turn back to me and stop worshiping those idols.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-14-6" id="en-CEV-18801"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Now, Ezekiel, tell everyone in Israel:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezek-14-6">I am the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God. Stop worshiping those idols I hate so much and come back to me.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezek-14-7" id="en-CEV-18802"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Suppose one of you Israelites or a foreigner living in Israel rejects me and starts worshiping idols. If you then go to a prophet to find out what I say, I will answer </span> <span class="text Ezek-14-8" id="en-CEV-18803"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>by turning against you. I will make you a warning to anyone who might think of doing the same thing, and you will no longer belong to my people. Then you will know that I am the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> and that you have sinned against me.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezek-14-9" id="en-CEV-18804"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>If a prophet gives a false message, I am the one who caused that prophet to lie. But I will still reject him and cut him off from my people, </span> <span class="text Ezek-14-10" id="en-CEV-18805"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>and anyone who goes to that prophet for a message will be punished in the same way. </span> <span class="text Ezek-14-11" id="en-CEV-18806"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>I will do this, so that you will come back to me and stop destroying yourselves with these disgusting sins. So turn back to me! Then I will be your God, and you will be my people. I, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God, make this promise.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Ezek-14-12" id="en-CEV-18807">Judgment on a Sinful Nation</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-14-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God said:</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-14-13" id="en-CEV-18808"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Ezekiel, son of man, suppose an entire nation sins against me, and I punish it by destroying the crops and letting its people and livestock starve to death. </span> <span class="text Ezek-14-14" id="en-CEV-18809"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup> Even if Noah, Daniel,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-18809a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-18809a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-18809a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> and Job were living in that nation, their faithfulness would not save anyone but themselves.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-14-15" id="en-CEV-18810"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Or suppose I punish a nation by sending wild animals to eat people and scare away every passerby, so that the land becomes a barren desert. </span> <span class="text Ezek-14-16" id="en-CEV-18811"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>As surely as I live, I promise that even if these three men lived in that nation, their own children would not be spared. The three men would live, but the land would be an empty desert.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-14-17" id="en-CEV-18812"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Or suppose I send an enemy to attack a sinful nation and kill its people and livestock. </span> <span class="text Ezek-14-18" id="en-CEV-18813"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>If these three men were in that nation when I punished it, not even their children would be spared. Only the three men would live.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-14-19" id="en-CEV-18814"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>And suppose I am so angry that I send a deadly disease to wipe out the people and livestock of a sinful nation. </span> <span class="text Ezek-14-20" id="en-CEV-18815"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Again, even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were living there, I, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, promise that the children of these faithful men would also die. Only the three of them would be spared.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-14-21" id="en-CEV-18816"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup> I am the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God, and I promise to punish Jerusalem severely. I will send war, starvation, wild animals, and deadly disease to slaughter its people and livestock. </span> <span class="text Ezek-14-22" id="en-CEV-18817"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>And those who survive will be taken from their country and led here to Babylonia. Ezekiel, when you see how sinful they are, you will know why I did all these things to Jerusalem. </span> <span class="text Ezek-14-23" id="en-CEV-18818"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>You will be convinced that I, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God, was right in doing what I did.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
