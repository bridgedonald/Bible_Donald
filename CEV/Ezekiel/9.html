<h3><span class="text Ezek-9-1" id="en-CEV-18692">The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> Gives the Command To Punish Jerusalem</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Ezek-9-1"><span class="chapternum">9 </span>After that, I heard the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> shout, “Come to Jerusalem, you men chosen to destroy the city. And bring your weapons!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-9-2" id="en-CEV-18693"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>I saw six men come through the north gate of the temple, each one holding a deadly weapon. A seventh man dressed in a linen robe was with them, and he was carrying things to write with. The men went into the temple and stood by the bronze altar.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-9-3" id="en-CEV-18694"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>The brightness of God's glory then left its place above the statues of the winged creatures<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-18694a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-18694a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-18694a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> inside the temple and moved to the entrance. The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to the man in the linen robe, </span> <span class="text Ezek-9-4" id="en-CEV-18695"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup> “Walk through the city of Jerusalem and mark the forehead of anyone who is truly upset and sad about the terrible things that are being done here.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-9-5-Ezek-9-6" id="en-CEV-18696"><sup class="versenum">5-6 </sup>He turned to the other six men and said, “Follow him and put to death everyone who doesn't have a mark on their forehead. Show no mercy or pity! Kill men and women, parents and children. Begin here at my temple, but be sure not to harm those who are marked.”</span></p><p><span class="text Ezek-9-5-Ezek-9-6">The men immediately killed the leaders who were standing there.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-9-7" id="en-CEV-18697"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Then the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said, “Pollute the temple by piling the dead bodies in the courtyards. Now get busy!” They left and started killing the people of Jerusalem.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-9-8" id="en-CEV-18698"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>I was then alone, so I bowed down and cried out to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, “Why are you doing this? Are you so angry with the people of Jerusalem that everyone must die?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-9-9" id="en-CEV-18699"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> answered, “The people of Israel and Judah have done horrible things. Their country is filled with murderers, and Jerusalem itself is filled with violence. They think that I have deserted them, and that I can't see what they are doing. </span> <span class="text Ezek-9-10" id="en-CEV-18700"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>And so I will not have pity on them or forgive them. They will be punished for what they have done.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-9-11" id="en-CEV-18701"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Just then, the man in the linen robe returned and said, “I have done what you commanded.”</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
