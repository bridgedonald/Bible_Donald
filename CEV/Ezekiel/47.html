<h3><span class="text Ezek-47-1" id="en-CEV-19714">The Stream Flowing from the Temple</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Ezek-47-1"><span class="chapternum">47 </span> The man took me back to the temple, where I saw a stream flowing from under the entrance. It began in the south part of the temple, where it ran past the altar and continued east through the courtyard.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-47-2" id="en-CEV-19715"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>We walked out of the temple area through the north gate and went around to the east gate. I saw the small stream of water flowing east from the south side of the gate.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-47-3" id="en-CEV-19716"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>The man walked east, then took out his measuring stick and measured 500 meters downstream. He told me to wade through the stream there, and the water came up to my ankles. </span> <span class="text Ezek-47-4" id="en-CEV-19717"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Then he measured another 500 meters downstream, and told me to wade through it there. The water came up to my knees. Another 500 meters downstream the water came up to my waist. </span> <span class="text Ezek-47-5" id="en-CEV-19718"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Another 500 meters downstream, the stream had become a river that could be crossed only by swimming. </span> <span class="text Ezek-47-6" id="en-CEV-19719"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>The man said, “Ezekiel, son of man, pay attention to what you've seen.”</span></p><p><span class="text Ezek-47-6">We walked to the riverbank, </span> <span class="text Ezek-47-7" id="en-CEV-19720"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>where I saw dozens of trees on each side. </span> <span class="text Ezek-47-8" id="en-CEV-19721"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>The man said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezek-47-8">This water flows eastward to the Jordan River valley and empties into the Dead Sea, where it turns the salt water into fresh water. </span> <span class="text Ezek-47-9" id="en-CEV-19722"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Wherever this water flows, there will be all kinds of animals and fish, because it will bring life and fresh water to the Dead Sea. </span> <span class="text Ezek-47-10" id="en-CEV-19723"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>From En-Gedi to Eneglaim, people will fish in the sea and dry their nets along the coast. There will be as many kinds of fish in the Dead Sea as there are in the Mediterranean Sea. </span> <span class="text Ezek-47-11" id="en-CEV-19724"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>But the marshes along the shore will remain salty, so that people can use the salt from them.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezek-47-12" id="en-CEV-19725"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup> Fruit trees will grow all along this river and produce fresh fruit every month. The leaves will never dry out, because they will always have water from the stream that flows from the temple, and they will be used for healing people.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Ezek-47-13-Ezek-47-14" id="en-CEV-19726">The Borders of the Land</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-47-13-Ezek-47-14"><sup class="versenum">13-14 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God said to the people of Israel:</span></p><p><span class="text Ezek-47-13-Ezek-47-14">When the land is divided among the twelve tribes of Israel, the Joseph tribe<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-19726a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-19726a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-19726a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> will receive two shares. Divide the land equally, because I promised your ancestors that this land would someday belong to their descendants. These are the borders of the land:</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-47-15" id="en-CEV-19727"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>The northern border will begin at the Mediterranean Sea, then continue eastward to Hethlon, to Lebo-Hamath, then across to Zedad, </span> <span class="text Ezek-47-16" id="en-CEV-19728"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Berothah,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-19728b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-19728b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-19728b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> and Sibraim, which is on the border between the two kingdoms of Damascus and Hamath. The border will end at Hazer-Hatticon, which is on the border of Hauran. </span> <span class="text Ezek-47-17" id="en-CEV-19729"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>So the northern border will run between the Mediterranean Sea and Hazar-Enon, which is on the border between Damascus and Hamath.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-19729c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-19729c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-19729c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-47-18" id="en-CEV-19730"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>The eastern border will begin on the border between the two kingdoms of Hauran and Damascus. It will run south along the Jordan River, which separates the territories of Gilead and Israel, and it will end at the Dead Sea near the town of Tamar.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-19730d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-19730d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-19730d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-47-19" id="en-CEV-19731"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>The southern border will begin at Tamar, then run southwest to the springs near Meribath-Kadesh. It will continue along the Egyptian Gorge and will end at the Mediterranean Sea.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-47-20" id="en-CEV-19732"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>The western border will run north along the Mediterranean Sea to a point just west of Lebo-Hamath.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-47-21" id="en-CEV-19733"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>That is the land to be divided among the tribes of Israel. </span> <span class="text Ezek-47-22" id="en-CEV-19734"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>It will belong to the Israelites and to any foreigners living among them whose children were born in Israel. These foreigners must be treated like any other Israelite citizen, and they will receive </span> <span class="text Ezek-47-23" id="en-CEV-19735"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>a share of the land given to the tribe where they live.
