It isn't like other trees in the forest, </span> <span class="text Ezek-15-3" id="en-CEV-18821"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>because the wood of a grapevine can't be used to make anything, not even a small peg to hang things on. </span> <span class="text Ezek-15-4" id="en-CEV-18822"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>It can only be used as firewood. But after its ends are burnt and its middle is charred, it can't be used for anything. </span> <span class="text Ezek-15-5" id="en-CEV-18823"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>The wood is useless before it is burned, and afterwards, it is completely worthless.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-15-6" id="en-CEV-18824"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>I, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God, promise that just as the wood of a grapevine is burned as firewood, </span> <span class="text Ezek-15-7" id="en-CEV-18825"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>I will punish the people of Jerusalem with fire. Some of them have escaped one destruction, but soon they will be completely burned. And when that happens, you, Ezekiel, will know that I am the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>. </span> <span class="text Ezek-15-8" id="en-CEV-18826"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>I will make their country an empty wasteland, because they have not been loyal to me. I, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God, have spoken.</span></p> </div>
