<h3><span class="text Ezek-34-1" id="en-CEV-19371">Israel's Leaders Are Worthless Shepherds</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Ezek-34-1"><span class="chapternum">34 </span> The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God said:</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-34-2" id="en-CEV-19372"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Ezekiel, son of man, Israel's leaders are like shepherds taking care of my sheep, the people of Israel. But I want you to condemn these leaders and tell them:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezek-34-2">I, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God, say you shepherds of Israel are doomed! You take care of yourselves while ignoring my sheep. </span> <span class="text Ezek-34-3" id="en-CEV-19373"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>You drink their milk and use their wool to make your clothes. Then you butcher the best ones for food. But you don't take care of the flock! </span> <span class="text Ezek-34-4" id="en-CEV-19374"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>You have never protected the weak ones or healed the sick ones or bandaged those that get hurt. You let them wander off and never look for those that get lost. You are cruel and mean to my sheep. </span> <span class="text Ezek-34-5" id="en-CEV-19375"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup> They strayed in every direction, and because there was no shepherd to watch them, they were attacked and eaten by wild animals. </span> <span class="text Ezek-34-6" id="en-CEV-19376"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>So my sheep were scattered across the earth. They roamed on hills and mountains, without anyone even bothering to look for them.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezek-34-7-Ezek-34-8" id="en-CEV-19377"><sup class="versenum">7-8 </sup>Now listen to what I, the living <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God, am saying to you shepherds. My sheep have been attacked and eaten by wild animals, because you refused to watch them. You never went looking for the lost ones, and you fed yourselves without feeding my sheep. </span> <span class="text Ezek-34-9-Ezek-34-10" id="en-CEV-19378"><sup class="versenum">9-10 </sup>So I, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, will punish you! I will rescue my sheep from you and never let you be their shepherd again or butcher them for food. I, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, have spoken.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Ezek-34-11" id="en-CEV-19379">The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> Is the Good Shepherd</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-34-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God then said:</span></p><p><span class="text Ezek-34-11">I will look for my sheep and take care of them myself, </span> <span class="text Ezek-34-12" id="en-CEV-19380"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>just as a shepherd looks for lost sheep.
