<h3><span class="text Ezek-5-1" id="en-CEV-18616">Jerusalem's Coming Destruction</span></h3><h4 class="speaker"><span class="text Ezek-5-1">The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said:</span></h4><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Ezek-5-1"><span class="chapternum">5 </span>Ezekiel, son of man, get a sharp sword and use it to cut off your hair and beard. Weigh the hair and divide it into three equal piles. </span> <span class="text Ezek-5-2" id="en-CEV-18617"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>After you attack the brick that stands for Jerusalem, burn one pile of your hair on the brick. Chop up the second pile and let the small pieces of hair fall around the brick. Throw the third pile into the wind, and I will strike it with my own sword.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-5-3" id="en-CEV-18618"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Keep a few of the hairs and wrap them in the hem of your clothes. </span> <span class="text Ezek-5-4" id="en-CEV-18619"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Then pull out a few of those hairs and throw them in the fire, so they will also burn. This fire will spread, destroying everyone in Israel.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-5-5" id="en-CEV-18620"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>I am the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God, and I have made Jerusalem the most important place in the world, and all other nations admire it. </span> <span class="text Ezek-5-6" id="en-CEV-18621"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>But the people of Jerusalem rebelled and refuse to obey me. They ignored my laws and have become even more sinful than the nations around them.</span></p> <p><span class="text Ezek-5-7" id="en-CEV-18622"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>So tell the people of Jerusalem:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezek-5-7">I am the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God! You have refused to obey my laws and teachings, and instead you have obeyed the laws of the surrounding nations. You have become more rebellious than any of them! </span> <span class="text Ezek-5-8" id="en-CEV-18623"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Now all those nations will watch as I turn against you and punish you </span> <span class="text Ezek-5-9" id="en-CEV-18624"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>for your sins. Your punishment will be more horrible than anything I've ever done or will ever do again. </span> <span class="text Ezek-5-10" id="en-CEV-18625"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup> Parents will be so desperate for food that they will eat their own children, and children will eat their parents. Those who survive this horror will be scattered in every direction.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezek-5-11" id="en-CEV-18626"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Your sins have disgusted me and made my temple unfit as a place to worship me. So I swear by my own life that I will cut you down<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-18626a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-18626a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-18626a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> and show you no pity. </span> <span class="text Ezek-5-12" id="en-CEV-18627"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>A third of you will die here in Jerusalem from disease or starvation. Another third will be killed in war. And I will scatter the last third of you in every direction, then track you down and kill you.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Ezek-5-13" id="en-CEV-18628"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>You will feel my fierce anger until I have finished taking revenge. Then you will know that I, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, was furious because of your disobedience. </span> <span class="text Ezek-5-14" id="en-CEV-18629"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Every passerby will laugh at your destruction. Foreign nations </span> <span class="text Ezek-5-15" id="en-CEV-18630"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>will insult you and make fun of you, but they will also be shocked and terrified at what I did in my anger. </span> <span class="text Ezek-5-16" id="en-CEV-18631"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>I will destroy your crops until you starve to death, and disasters will strike you like arrows. </span> <span class="text Ezek-5-17" id="en-CEV-18632"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup> Starvation and wild animals will kill your children. I'll punish you with horrible diseases, and your enemies will strike you down with their swords.
