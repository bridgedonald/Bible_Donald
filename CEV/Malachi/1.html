And yet you ask in what way have I loved you. Don't forget that Esau was the brother of your ancestor Jacob, but I chose Jacob </span> <span class="text Mal-1-3" id="en-CEV-21073"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>instead of Esau. And I turned Esau's hill country into a barren desert where jackals<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-21073a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-21073a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-21073a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> roam. </span> <span class="text Mal-1-4" id="en-CEV-21074"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Esau's descendants may say, “Although our nation Edom is in ruins, we will rebuild it.”</span></p><p><span class="text Mal-1-4">But I, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> All-Powerful, promise to tear down whatever they build.

Children respect their fathers, and servants respect their masters. I am your father and your master, so why don't you respect me? You priests have insulted me, and now you ask, “How did we insult you?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Mal-1-7" id="en-CEV-21077"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>You embarrass me by offering worthless food on my altar.
