Otherwise, when you give a blessing, I will turn it into a curse. In fact, I have already done this, because you haven't taken to heart your duties as priests. </span> <span class="text Mal-2-3" id="en-CEV-21087"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>I will punish your descendants and rub your faces in the manure from your animal sacrifices, and then be done with you.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-21087a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-21087a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-21087a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text Mal-2-4" id="en-CEV-21088"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup> I am telling you this, so I can continue to keep my agreement with your ancestor Levi. </span> <span class="text Mal-2-5" id="en-CEV-21089"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup> I blessed him with a full life, as I had promised, and he kept his part of the agreement by honoring me and respecting my name. </span> <span class="text Mal-2-6" id="en-CEV-21090"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>He taught the truth and never told lies, and he led a lot of people to turn from sin, because he obeyed me and lived right.</span></p> <p><span class="text Mal-2-7" id="en-CEV-21091"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>You priests should be eager to spread knowledge, and everyone should come to you for instruction, because you speak for me, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> All-Powerful. </span> <span class="text Mal-2-8" id="en-CEV-21092"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>But you have turned your backs on me. Your teachings have led others to do sinful things, and you have broken the agreement I made with your ancestor Levi. </span> <span class="text Mal-2-9" id="en-CEV-21093"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>So I caused everyone to hate and despise you, because you disobeyed me and failed to treat all people alike.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Mal-2-10" id="en-CEV-21094">A Broken Agreement</span></h3><p><span class="text Mal-2-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Don't you know that we all have God as our Father?

It's because he knows that each of you men has been unfaithful to the wife you married when you were young.
