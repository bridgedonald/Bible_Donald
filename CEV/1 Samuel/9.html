<h3><span class="text 1Sam-9-1" id="en-CEV-6203">Saul Meets Samuel</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text 1Sam-9-1"><span class="chapternum">9 </span>Kish was a wealthy man who belonged to the tribe of Benjamin. His father was Abiel, his grandfather was Zeror, his great-grandfather was Becorath, and his great-great-grandfather was Aphiah. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-9-2" id="en-CEV-6204"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Kish had a son named Saul, who was better looking and more than a head taller than anyone else in all Israel.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-9-3" id="en-CEV-6205"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Kish owned some donkeys, but they had run off. So he told Saul, “Take one of the servants and go look for the donkeys.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-9-4" id="en-CEV-6206"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Saul and the servant went through the hill country of Ephraim and the territory of Shalishah, but they could not find the donkeys. Then they went through the territories of Shaalim and Benjamin, but still there was no sign of the donkeys. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-9-5" id="en-CEV-6207"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Finally they came to the territory where the clan of Zuph<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-6207a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-6207a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-6207a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> lived. “Let's go back home,” Saul told his servant. “If we don't go back soon, my father will stop worrying about the donkeys and start worrying about us!”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-9-6" id="en-CEV-6208"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>“Wait!” the servant answered. “There's a man of God who lives in a town near here. He's amazing! Everything he says comes true. Let's talk to him. Maybe he can tell us where to look.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-9-7" id="en-CEV-6209"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Saul said, “How can we talk to the prophet when I don't have anything to give him? We don't even have any bread left in our sacks. What can we give him?”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-9-8" id="en-CEV-6210"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>“I have a small piece of silver,” the servant answered. “We can give him that, and then he will tell us where to look for the donkeys.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-9-9-1Sam-9-10" id="en-CEV-6211"><sup class="versenum">9-10 </sup>“Great!” Saul replied. “Let's go to the man who can see visions!” He said this because in those days God would answer questions by giving visions to prophets.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-9-9-1Sam-9-10">Saul and his servant went to the town where the prophet lived. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-9-11" id="en-CEV-6212"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>As they were going up the hill to the town, they met some young women coming out to get water,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-6212b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-6212b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-6212b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> and the two men said to them, “We're looking for the man who can see visions. Is he in town?”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-9-12" id="en-CEV-6213"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>“Yes, he is,” they replied. “He's in town today because there's going to be a sacrifice and a sacred meal at the place of worship. In fact, he's just ahead of you. Hurry </span> <span class="text 1Sam-9-13" id="en-CEV-6214"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>and you should find him right inside the town gate. He's on his way out to the place of worship to eat with the invited guests. They can't start eating until he blesses the sacrifice. If you go now, you should find him.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-9-14" id="en-CEV-6215"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>They went to the town, and just as they were going through the gate, Samuel was coming out on his way to the place of worship.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-9-15" id="en-CEV-6216"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>The day before Saul came, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had told Samuel, </span> <span class="text 1Sam-9-16" id="en-CEV-6217"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>“I've seen how my people are suffering, and I've heard their call for help.

He's the one who will rule Israel.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-9-18" id="en-CEV-6219"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Saul went over to Samuel in the gateway and said, “A man who can see visions lives here in town. Could you tell me the way to his house?”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-9-19" id="en-CEV-6220"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>“I am the one who sees visions!” Samuel answered. “Go on up to the place of worship. You will eat with me today, and in the morning I'll answer your questions. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-9-20" id="en-CEV-6221"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Don't worry about your donkeys that ran off three days ago.

About 30 people were there for the dinner, but Samuel gave Saul and his servant the places of honor. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-9-23-1Sam-9-24" id="en-CEV-6224"><sup class="versenum">23-24 </sup>Then Samuel told the cook, “I gave you the best piece of meat and told you to set it aside. Bring it here now.”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-9-23-1Sam-9-24">The cook brought the meat over and set it down in front of Saul. “This is for you,” Samuel told him. “Go ahead and eat it.
