The town leaders went to meet him, but they were terribly afraid and asked, “Is this a friendly visit?”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-16-5" id="en-CEV-6399"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>“Yes, it is!” Samuel answered. “I've come to offer a sacrifice to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>.

He isn't the one I've chosen. People judge others by what they look like, but I judge people by what is in their hearts.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-16-8" id="en-CEV-6402"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Jesse told his son Abinadab to go over to Samuel, but Samuel said, “No, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> hasn't chosen him.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-16-9" id="en-CEV-6403"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Next, Jesse sent his son Shammah to him, and Samuel said, “The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> hasn't chosen him either.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-16-10" id="en-CEV-6404"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>One by one, Jesse told all seven of his sons to go over to Samuel.

He was a healthy, good-looking boy with a sparkle in his eyes. As soon as David came, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> told Samuel, “He's the one! Get up and pour the olive oil on his head.”<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-6406e" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-6406e" title="See footnote e"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-6406e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-16-13" id="en-CEV-6407"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Samuel poured the oil on David's head while his brothers watched.
