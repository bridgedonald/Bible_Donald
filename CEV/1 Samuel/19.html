<h3><span class="text 1Sam-19-1" id="en-CEV-6502">Saul Tries To Have David Killed</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text 1Sam-19-1"><span class="chapternum">19 </span>One day, Saul told his son Jonathan and his officers to kill David. But Jonathan and David were best friends, </span> <span class="text 1Sam-19-2-1Sam-19-3" id="en-CEV-6503"><sup class="versenum">2-3 </sup>and he warned David, “My father is trying to have you killed, so be very careful. Hide in a field tomorrow morning, and I'll bring him there. Then I'll talk to him about you, and if I find out anything, I'll let you know.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-19-4-1Sam-19-5" id="en-CEV-6504"><sup class="versenum">4-5 </sup>The next morning, Jonathan reminded Saul about the many good things David had done for him. Then he said, “Why do you want to kill David? He hasn't done anything to you. He has served in your army and has always done what's best for you. He even risked his life to kill Goliath. The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> helped Israel win a great victory that day, and it made you happy.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-19-6" id="en-CEV-6505"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Saul agreed and promised, “I swear by the living <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> that I won't have David killed!”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-19-7" id="en-CEV-6506"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Jonathan went to David and told him what Saul had said. Then he brought David to Saul, and David served in Saul's army just as he had done before.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-19-8" id="en-CEV-6507"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>The next time there was a war with the Philistines, David fought hard and forced them to retreat.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 1Sam-19-9-1Sam-19-10" id="en-CEV-6508">Michal Helps David Escape</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Sam-19-9-1Sam-19-10"><sup class="versenum">9-10 </sup>One night, David was in Saul's home, playing the harp for him. Saul was sitting there, holding a spear, when an evil spirit from the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> took control of him. Saul tried to pin David to the wall with the spear, but David dodged, and it stuck in the wall. David ran out of the house and escaped.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-19-11" id="en-CEV-6509"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup> Saul sent guards to watch David's house all night and then to kill him in the morning.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-19-11">Michal, David's wife, told him, “If you don't escape tonight, they'll kill you tomorrow!” </span> <span class="text 1Sam-19-12" id="en-CEV-6510"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>She helped David leave through a window and climb down to the ground.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-6510a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-6510a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-6510a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> As David ran off, </span> <span class="text 1Sam-19-13" id="en-CEV-6511"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Michal put a statue in his bed.

But Michal told them, “David is sick.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-19-15" id="en-CEV-6513"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Saul sent the guards back and told them, “Bring David to me—bed and all—so I can kill him.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-19-16" id="en-CEV-6514"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>When the guards went in, all they found in the bed was the statue with the goat hair on its head.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-19-17" id="en-CEV-6515"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>“Why have you tricked me this way?” Saul asked Michal. “You helped my enemy get away!”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-19-17">She answered, “He said he would kill me if I didn't help him escape!”</span></p> <h3><span class="text 1Sam-19-18" id="en-CEV-6516">Samuel Helps David Escape</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Sam-19-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Meanwhile, David went to Samuel at Ramah and told him what Saul had done.

They went to Ramah and found Samuel in charge of a group of prophets who were all prophesying. Then the Spirit of God took control of the soldiers and they started prophesying too.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-19-21" id="en-CEV-6519"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>When Saul heard what had happened, he sent some more soldiers, but they prophesied just like the first group.

He dropped to the ground and lay there naked all that day and night. That's how the saying started, “Is Saul now a prophet?”</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
