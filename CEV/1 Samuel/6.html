Tell us how to send it back where it belongs!”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-6-3" id="en-CEV-6150"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>“Don't send it back without a gift,” the priests and fortunetellers answered. “Send along something to Israel's God to make up for taking the chest in the first place. Then you will be healed, and you will find out why the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> was causing you so much trouble.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-6-4" id="en-CEV-6151"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>“What should we send?” the Philistines asked.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-6-4">The priests and fortunetellers answered:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Sam-6-4">There are five Philistine rulers, and they all have the same disease that you have. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-6-5" id="en-CEV-6152"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>So make five gold models of the sores and five gold models of the rats that are wiping out your crops.

Put the gold rats and sores into a bag and put it on the cart next to the chest. Then send it on its way.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Sam-6-9" id="en-CEV-6156"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Watch to see if the chest goes on up the road to the Israelite town of Beth-Shemesh. If it goes back to its own country, you will know that it was the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> who made us suffer so badly. But if the chest doesn't go back to its own country, then the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had nothing to do with the disease that hit us—it was simply bad luck.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-6-10" id="en-CEV-6157"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>The Philistines followed their advice.

Some men from the tribe of Levi were there. So they took the chest off the cart and placed it on the rock, and then they did the same thing with the bag of gold rats and sores. A few other people chopped up the cart and made a fire. They killed the cows and burned them as sacrifices to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>. After that, they offered more sacrifices.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-6-16" id="en-CEV-6162"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>When the five rulers of the Philistines saw what had happened, they went back to Ekron that same day.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-6-17" id="en-CEV-6163"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>That is how the Philistines sent gifts to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> to make up for taking the sacred chest.
