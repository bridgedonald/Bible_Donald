<h3><span class="text 1Sam-12-1" id="en-CEV-6270">Samuel's Farewell Speech</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text 1Sam-12-1"><span class="chapternum">12 </span>Samuel told the Israelites:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Sam-12-1">I have given you a king, just as you asked. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-12-2" id="en-CEV-6271"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>You have seen how I have led you ever since I was a young man. I'm already old. My hair is gray, and my own sons are grown. Now you must see how well your king will lead you.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Sam-12-3" id="en-CEV-6272"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup> Let me ask this. Have I ever taken anyone's ox or donkey or forced you to give me anything? Have I ever hurt anyone or taken a bribe to give an unfair decision? Answer me so the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> and his chosen king can hear you. And if I have done any of these things, I will give it all back.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-12-4" id="en-CEV-6273"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>“No,” the Israelites answered. “You've never cheated us in any way!”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-12-5" id="en-CEV-6274"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Samuel said, “The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> and his chosen king are witnesses to what you have said.”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-12-5">“That's true,” they replied.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-12-6" id="en-CEV-6275"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup> Then Samuel told them:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Sam-12-6">The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> brought your ancestors out of Egypt and chose Moses and Aaron to be your leaders. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-12-7" id="en-CEV-6276"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Now the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will be your judge. So stand here and listen, while I remind you how often the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has saved you and your ancestors from your enemies.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Sam-12-8" id="en-CEV-6277"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup> After Jacob went to Egypt, your ancestors cried out to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> for help, and he sent Moses and Aaron. They brought your ancestors out of Egypt and led them here to settle this land. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-12-9" id="en-CEV-6278"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup> But your ancestors forgot the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, so he let them be defeated by the Philistines, the king of Moab, and Sisera, the commander of Hazor's army.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Sam-12-10" id="en-CEV-6279"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup> Again your ancestors cried out to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> for help. They said, “We have sinned! We stopped worshiping you, our <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, and started worshiping Baal and Astarte. But now, if you rescue us from our enemies, we will worship you.”</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Sam-12-11" id="en-CEV-6280"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup> The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> sent Gideon,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-6280a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-6280a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-6280a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> Bedan, Jephthah, and Samuel to rescue you from your enemies, and you didn't have to worry about being attacked. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-12-12" id="en-CEV-6281"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup> Then you saw that King Nahash of Ammon was going to attack you. And even though the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> your God is your king, you told me, “This time it's different. We want a king to rule us!”</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Sam-12-13" id="en-CEV-6282"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>You asked for a king, and you chose one. Now he stands here where all of you can see him. But it was really the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> who made him your king. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-12-14" id="en-CEV-6283"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>If you and your king want to be followers of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, you must worship him<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-6283b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-6283b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-6283b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> and do what he says. Don't be stubborn! </span> <span class="text 1Sam-12-15" id="en-CEV-6284"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>If you're stubborn and refuse to obey the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, he will turn against you and your king.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-6284c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-6284c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-6284c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup></span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Sam-12-16" id="en-CEV-6285"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Just stand here and watch the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> show his mighty power. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-12-17" id="en-CEV-6286"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Isn't this the dry season?<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-6286d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-6286d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-6286d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> I'm going to ask the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> to send a thunderstorm. When you see it, you will realize how wrong you were to ask for a king.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-12-18" id="en-CEV-6287"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Samuel prayed, and that same day the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> sent a thunderstorm. Everyone was afraid of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> and of Samuel. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-12-19" id="en-CEV-6288"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>They told Samuel, “Please, pray to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> your God for us! We don't want to die. We have sinned many times in the past, and we were very wrong to ask for a king.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-12-20" id="en-CEV-6289"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Samuel answered:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Sam-12-20">Even though what you did was wrong, you don't need to be afraid. But you must always follow the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> and worship him with all your heart. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-12-21" id="en-CEV-6290"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Don't worship idols! They don't have any power, and they can't help you or save you when you're in trouble. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-12-22" id="en-CEV-6291"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>But the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has chosen you to be his own people. He will always take care of you so that everyone will know how great he is.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Sam-12-23" id="en-CEV-6292"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>I would be disobeying the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> if I stopped praying for you! I will always teach you how to live right. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-12-24" id="en-CEV-6293"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>You also must obey the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>—you must worship him with all your heart and remember the great things he has done for you. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-12-25" id="en-CEV-6294"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>But if you and your king do evil, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will wipe you out.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
