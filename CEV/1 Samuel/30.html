<h3><span class="text 1Sam-30-1" id="en-CEV-6756">David Rescues His Soldiers' Families</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text 1Sam-30-1"><span class="chapternum">30 </span>It took David and his men three days to reach Ziklag. But while they had been away, the Amalekites had been raiding in the desert around there. They had attacked Ziklag, burned it to the ground, </span> <span class="text 1Sam-30-2" id="en-CEV-6757"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>and had taken away the women and children. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-30-3" id="en-CEV-6758"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>When David and his men came to Ziklag, they saw the burned-out ruins and learned that their families had been taken captive. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-30-4" id="en-CEV-6759"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>They started crying and kept it up until they were too weak to cry any more. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-30-5" id="en-CEV-6760"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup> David's two wives, Ahinoam and Abigail, had been taken captive with everyone else.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-30-6" id="en-CEV-6761"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>David was desperate. His soldiers were so upset over what had happened to their sons and daughters that they were thinking about stoning David to death. But he felt the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God giving him strength, </span> <span class="text 1Sam-30-7" id="en-CEV-6762"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup> and he said to the priest, “Abiathar, let's ask God what to do.”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-30-7">Abiathar brought everything he needed to get answers from God, and he went over to David. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-30-8" id="en-CEV-6763"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Then David asked the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, “Should I go after the people who raided our town? Can I catch up with them?”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-30-8">“Go after them,” the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> answered. “You will catch up with them, and you will rescue your families.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-30-9-1Sam-30-10" id="en-CEV-6764"><sup class="versenum">9-10 </sup>David led his 600 men to Besor Gorge, but 200 of them were too tired to go across. So they stayed behind, while David and the other 400 men crossed the gorge.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-30-11" id="en-CEV-6765"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Some of David's men found an Egyptian out in a field and took him to David. They gave the Egyptian some bread, and he ate it. Then they gave him a drink of water, </span> <span class="text 1Sam-30-12" id="en-CEV-6766"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>some dried figs, and two handfuls of raisins. This was the first time in three days he had tasted food or water. Now he felt much better.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-30-13" id="en-CEV-6767"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>“Who is your master?” David asked. “And where do you come from?”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-30-13">“I'm from Egypt,” the young man answered. “I'm the servant of an Amalekite, but he left me here three days ago because I was sick. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-30-14" id="en-CEV-6768"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>We had attacked some towns in the desert where the Cherethites live, in the area that belongs to Judah, and in the desert where the Caleb clan lives. And we burned down Ziklag.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-30-15" id="en-CEV-6769"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>“Will you take me to those Amalekites?” David asked.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-30-15">“Yes, I will, if you promise with God as a witness that you won't kill me or hand me over to my master.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-30-16" id="en-CEV-6770"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>He led David to the Amalekites. They were eating and drinking everywhere, celebrating because of what they had taken from Philistia and Judah. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-30-17" id="en-CEV-6771"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>David attacked just before sunrise the next day and fought until sunset.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-6771a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-6771a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-6771a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> Four hundred Amalekites rode away on camels, but they were the only ones who escaped.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-30-18" id="en-CEV-6772"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>David rescued his two wives and everyone else the Amalekites had taken from Ziklag. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-30-19" id="en-CEV-6773"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>No one was missing—young or old, sons or daughters. David brought back everything that had been stolen, </span> <span class="text 1Sam-30-20" id="en-CEV-6774"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>including their livestock.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-30-20">David also took the sheep and cattle that the Amalekites had with them, but he kept these separate from the others. Everyone agreed that these would be David's reward.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-30-21" id="en-CEV-6775"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>On the way back, David went to the 200 men he had left at Besor Gorge, because they had been too tired to keep up with him. They came toward David and the people who were with him. When David was close enough, he greeted the 200 men and asked how they were doing.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-30-22" id="en-CEV-6776"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Some of David's men were good-for-nothings, and they said, “Those men didn't go with us to the battle, so they don't get any of the things we took back from the Amalekites. Let them take their wives and children and go!”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-30-23" id="en-CEV-6777"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>But David said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Sam-30-23">My friends, don't be so greedy with what the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has given us! The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> protected us and gave us victory over the people who attacked. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-30-24" id="en-CEV-6778"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>Who would pay attention to you, anyway? Soldiers who stay behind to guard the camp get as much as those who go into battle.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-30-25" id="en-CEV-6779"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>David made this a law for Israel, and it has been the same ever since.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-30-26" id="en-CEV-6780"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>David went back to Ziklag with everything they had taken from the Amalekites. He sent some of these things as gifts to his friends who were leaders of Judah, and he told them, “We took these things from the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s enemies. Please accept them as a gift.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-30-27-1Sam-30-31" id="en-CEV-6781"><sup class="versenum">27-31 </sup>This is a list of the towns where David sent gifts: Bethel,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-6781b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-6781b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-6781b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> Ramoth in the Southern Desert, Jattir, Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa, Racal, the towns belonging to the Jerahmeelites and the Kenites, Hormah, Bor-Ashan, Athach, and Hebron. He also sent gifts to the other towns where he and his men had traveled.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
