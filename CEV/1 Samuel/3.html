In those days, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> hardly ever spoke directly to people, and he did not appear to them in dreams very often. But one night, Eli was asleep in his room, </span> <span class="text 1Sam-3-3" id="en-CEV-6097"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>and Samuel was sleeping on a mat near the sacred chest in the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s house. They had not been asleep very long<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-6097a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-6097a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-6097a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text 1Sam-3-4" id="en-CEV-6098"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>when the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> called out Samuel's name.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-3-4">“Here I am!” Samuel answered. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-3-5" id="en-CEV-6099"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Then he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am. What do you want?”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-3-5">“I didn't call you,” Eli answered. “Go back to bed.”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-3-5">Samuel went back.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-3-6" id="en-CEV-6100"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Again the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> called out Samuel's name. Samuel got up and went to Eli. “Here I am,” he said. “What do you want?”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-3-6">Eli told him, “Son, I didn't call you. Go back to sleep.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-3-7" id="en-CEV-6101"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had not spoken to Samuel before, and Samuel did not recognize the voice. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-3-8" id="en-CEV-6102"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>When the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> called out his name for the third time, Samuel went to Eli again and said, “Here I am. What do you want?”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-3-8">Eli finally realized that it was the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> who was speaking to Samuel. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-3-9" id="en-CEV-6103"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>So he said, “Go back and lie down! If someone speaks to you again, answer, ‘I'm listening, <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>. What do you want me to do?’ ”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-3-9">Once again Samuel went back and lay down.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-3-10" id="en-CEV-6104"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> then stood beside Samuel and called out as he had done before, “Samuel! Samuel!”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-3-10">“I'm listening,” Samuel answered. “What do you want me to do?”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-3-11" id="en-CEV-6105"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Sam-3-11">Samuel, I am going to do something in Israel that will shock everyone who hears about it! </span> <span class="text 1Sam-3-12" id="en-CEV-6106"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>I will punish Eli and his family, just as I promised. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-3-13" id="en-CEV-6107"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>He knew that his sons refused to respect me,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-6107b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-6107b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-6107b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> and he let them get away with it, even though I said I would punish his family forever. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-3-14" id="en-CEV-6108"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>I warned Eli that sacrifices or offerings could never make things right!
