<h3><span class="text 1Sam-24-1" id="en-CEV-6628">David Lets Saul Live</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text 1Sam-24-1"><span class="chapternum">24 </span>When Saul got back from fighting off the Philistines, he heard that David was in the desert around En-Gedi. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-24-2" id="en-CEV-6629"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Saul led 3,000 of Israel's best soldiers out to look for David and his men near Wild Goat Rocks at En-Gedi. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-24-3" id="en-CEV-6630"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup> There were some sheep pens along the side of the road, and one of them was built around the entrance to a cave. Saul went into the cave to relieve himself.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-24-3">David and his men were hiding at the back of the cave. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-24-4" id="en-CEV-6631"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>They whispered to David, “The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> told you he was going to let you defeat your enemies and do whatever you want with them. This must be the day the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> was talking about.”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-24-4">David sneaked over and cut off a small piece<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-6631a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-6631a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-6631a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> of Saul's robe, but Saul didn't notice a thing. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-24-5" id="en-CEV-6632"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Afterwards, David was sorry that he had even done that, </span> <span class="text 1Sam-24-6-1Sam-24-7" id="en-CEV-6633"><sup class="versenum">6-7 </sup> and he told his men, “Stop talking foolishly. We're not going to attack Saul. He's my king, and I pray that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will keep me from doing anything to harm his chosen king.”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-24-6-1Sam-24-7">Saul left the cave and started down the road. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-24-8" id="en-CEV-6634"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Soon, David also got up and left the cave. “Your Majesty!” he shouted from a distance.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-24-8">Saul turned around to look. David bowed down very low </span> <span class="text 1Sam-24-9" id="en-CEV-6635"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>and said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Sam-24-9">Your Majesty, why do you listen to people who say that I'm trying to harm you? </span> <span class="text 1Sam-24-10" id="en-CEV-6636"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>You can see for yourself that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> gave me the chance to catch you in the cave today. Some of my men wanted to kill you, but I wouldn't let them do it. I told them, “I will not harm the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s chosen king!” </span> <span class="text 1Sam-24-11" id="en-CEV-6637"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Your Majesty, look at what I'm holding. You can see that it's a piece of your robe. If I could cut off a piece of your robe, I could have killed you. But I let you live, and that should prove I'm not trying to harm you or to rebel. I haven't done anything to you, and yet you keep trying to ambush and kill me.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Sam-24-12" id="en-CEV-6638"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>I'll let the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> decide which one of us has done right. I pray that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will punish you for what you're doing to me, but I won't do anything to you. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-24-13" id="en-CEV-6639"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>An old proverb says, “Only evil people do evil things,” and so I won't harm you.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Sam-24-14" id="en-CEV-6640"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup> Why should the king of Israel be out chasing me, anyway? I'm as worthless as a dead dog or a flea. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-24-15" id="en-CEV-6641"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>I pray that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will help me escape and show that I am in the right.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-24-16" id="en-CEV-6642"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>“David, my son—is that you?” Saul asked. Then he started crying </span> <span class="text 1Sam-24-17" id="en-CEV-6643"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>and said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Sam-24-17">David, you're a better person than I am. You treated me with kindness, even though I've been cruel to you. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-24-18" id="en-CEV-6644"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>You've told me how you were kind enough not to kill me when the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> gave you the chance. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-24-19" id="en-CEV-6645"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>If you really were my enemy, you wouldn't have let me leave here alive. I pray that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will give you a big reward for what you did today.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Sam-24-20" id="en-CEV-6646"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>I realize now that you will be the next king, and a powerful king at that. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-24-21" id="en-CEV-6647"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Promise me with the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> as your witness, that you won't wipe out my descendants. Let them live to keep my family name alive.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-24-22" id="en-CEV-6648"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>So David promised, and Saul went home. David and his men returned to their hideout.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
