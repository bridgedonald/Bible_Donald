Ahimelech was trembling with fear as he came out to meet David. “Why are you alone?” Ahimelech asked. “Why isn't anyone else with you?”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-21-2" id="en-CEV-6564"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>“I'm on a mission for King Saul,” David answered. “He ordered me not to tell anyone what the mission is all about, so I ordered my soldiers to stay somewhere else. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-21-3" id="en-CEV-6565"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Do you have any food you can give me? Could you spare five loaves of bread?”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-21-4" id="en-CEV-6566"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>“The only bread I have is the sacred bread,” the priest told David. “You can have it if your soldiers didn't sleep with women last night.”<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-6566a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-6566a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-6566a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-21-5" id="en-CEV-6567"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>“Of course we didn't sleep with women,” David answered. “I never let my men do that when we're on a mission. They have to be acceptable to worship God even when we're on a regular mission, and today we're on a special mission.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-21-6" id="en-CEV-6568"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup> The only bread the priest had was the sacred bread that he had taken from the place of worship after putting out the fresh loaves. So he gave it to David.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-21-7" id="en-CEV-6569"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>It so happened that one of Saul's officers was there, worshiping the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> that day.

I had to leave so quickly on this mission for the king that I didn't bring along my sword or any other weapons.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-21-9" id="en-CEV-6571"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup> The priest answered, “The only sword here is the one that belonged to Goliath the Philistine. You were the one who killed him in Elah Valley, and so you can take his sword if you want to. It's wrapped in a cloth behind the statue.”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-21-9">“It's the best sword there is,” David said. “I'll take it!”</span></p> <h3><span class="text 1Sam-21-10" id="en-CEV-6572">David Tries To Find Safety in Gath</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Sam-21-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>David kept on running from Saul that day until he came to Gath,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-6572d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-6572d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-6572d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> where he met with King Achish. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-21-11" id="en-CEV-6573"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup> The officers of King Achish were also there, and they asked Achish, “Isn't David a king back in his own country?
