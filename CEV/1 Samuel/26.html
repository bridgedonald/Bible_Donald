But David was hiding out in the desert.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-26-3">When David heard that Saul was following him, </span> <span class="text 1Sam-26-4" id="en-CEV-6690"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>he sent some spies to find out if it was true. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-26-5" id="en-CEV-6691"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Then he sneaked up to Saul's camp. He noticed that Saul and his army commander Abner the son of Ner were sleeping in the middle of the camp, with soldiers sleeping all around them. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-26-6" id="en-CEV-6692"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>David asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Joab's brother Abishai,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-6692b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-6692b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-6692b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> “Which one of you will go with me into Saul's camp?”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-26-6">“I will!” Abishai answered.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-26-7" id="en-CEV-6693"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>That same night, David and Abishai crept into the camp. Saul was sleeping, and his spear was stuck in the ground not far from his head. Abner and the soldiers were sound asleep all around him.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-26-8" id="en-CEV-6694"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Abishai whispered, “This time God has let you get your hands on your enemy!

None of Saul's soldiers knew what had happened or even woke up—the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had made all of them fall sound asleep. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-26-13" id="en-CEV-6699"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>David and Abishai crossed the valley and went to the top of the next hill, where they were at a safe distance. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-26-14" id="en-CEV-6700"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>“Abner!” David shouted toward Saul's army. “Can you hear me?”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-26-14">Abner shouted back. “Who dares disturb the king?”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-26-15" id="en-CEV-6701"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>“Abner, what kind of a man are you?” David replied. “Aren't you supposed to be the best soldier in Israel?
