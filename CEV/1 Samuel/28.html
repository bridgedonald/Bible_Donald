<h3><span class="text 1Sam-28-1-1Sam-28-3" id="en-CEV-6723">Saul Asks To Talk with Samuel's Ghost</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text 1Sam-28-1-1Sam-28-3"><span class="chapternum">28 </span><sup class="versenum">1-3 </sup> Samuel had died some time earlier,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-6723a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-6723a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-6723a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> and people from all over Israel had attended his funeral in his hometown of Ramah.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-28-1-1Sam-28-3">Meanwhile, Saul had been trying to get rid of everyone who spoke with the spirits of the dead.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-6723b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-6723b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-6723b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> But one day the Philistines brought their soldiers together to attack Israel.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-28-1-1Sam-28-3">Achish told David, “Of course, you know that you and your men must fight as part of our Philistine army.”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-28-1-1Sam-28-3">David answered, “That will give you a chance to see for yourself just how well we can fight!”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-28-1-1Sam-28-3">“In that case,” Achish said, “you and your men will always be my bodyguards.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-28-4" id="en-CEV-6724"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>The Philistines went to Shunem and set up camp. Saul called the army of Israel together, and they set up their camp in Gilboa. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-28-5" id="en-CEV-6725"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Saul took one look at the Philistine army and started shaking with fear. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-28-6" id="en-CEV-6726"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup> So he asked the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> what to do. But the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> would not answer, either in a dream or by a priest or a prophet. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-28-7" id="en-CEV-6727"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Then Saul told his officers, “Find me a woman who can talk to the spirits of the dead. I'll go to her and find out what's going to happen.”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-28-7">His servants told him, “There's a woman at Endor who can talk to spirits of the dead.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-28-8" id="en-CEV-6728"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>That night, Saul put on different clothing so nobody would recognize him. Then he and two of his men went to the woman, and asked, “Will you bring up the ghost of someone for us?”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-28-9" id="en-CEV-6729"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>The woman said, “Why are you trying to trick me and get me killed? You know King Saul has killed everyone who talks to the spirits of the dead!”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-28-10" id="en-CEV-6730"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Saul replied, “I swear by the living <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> that nothing will happen to you because of this.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-28-11" id="en-CEV-6731"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup> “Who do you want me to bring up?” she asked.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-28-11">“Bring up the ghost of Samuel,” he answered.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-28-12" id="en-CEV-6732"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>When the woman saw Samuel, she screamed. Then she turned to Saul and said, “You've tricked me! You're the king!”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-28-13" id="en-CEV-6733"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>“Don't be afraid,” Saul replied. “Just tell me what you see.”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-28-13">She answered, “I see a spirit rising up out of the ground.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-28-14" id="en-CEV-6734"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>“What does it look like?”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-28-14">“It looks like an old man wearing a robe.”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-28-14">Saul knew it was Samuel, so he bowed down low.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-28-15" id="en-CEV-6735"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>“Why are you bothering me by bringing me up like this?” Samuel asked.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-28-15">“I'm terribly worried,” Saul answered. “The Philistines are about to attack me. God has turned his back on me and won't answer any more by prophets or by dreams. What should I do?”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-28-16" id="en-CEV-6736"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Samuel said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Sam-28-16">If the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has turned away from you and is now your enemy, don't ask me what to do. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-28-17" id="en-CEV-6737"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup> I've already told you: The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has sworn to take the kingdom from you and give it to David. And that's just what he's doing! </span> <span class="text 1Sam-28-18" id="en-CEV-6738"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup> When the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> was angry with the Amalekites, he told you to destroy them, but you didn't do it. That's why the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> is doing this to you. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-28-19" id="en-CEV-6739"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Tomorrow the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will let the Philistines defeat Israel's army, then you and your sons will join me down here in the world of the dead.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-28-20" id="en-CEV-6740"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>At once, Saul collapsed and lay stretched out on the floor, terrified at what Samuel had said. He was weak because he had not eaten anything since the day before.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-28-21" id="en-CEV-6741"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>The woman came over to Saul, and when she saw that he was completely terrified, she said, “Your Majesty, I listened to you and risked my life to do what you asked. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-28-22" id="en-CEV-6742"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Now please listen to me. Let me get you a little something to eat. It will give you strength for your walk back to camp.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-28-23" id="en-CEV-6743"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>“No, I won't eat!”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-28-23">But his officers and the woman kept on urging Saul, until he finally agreed. He got up off the floor and sat on the bed. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-28-24" id="en-CEV-6744"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>At once the woman killed a calf that she had been fattening up. She cooked part of the meat and baked some thin bread.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-6744c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-6744c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-6744c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text 1Sam-28-25" id="en-CEV-6745"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Then she served the food to Saul and his officers, who ate and left before daylight.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
