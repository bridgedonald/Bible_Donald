A soldier always walked in front of Goliath to carry his shield.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-17-8" id="en-CEV-6423"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Goliath went out and shouted to the army of Israel:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Sam-17-8">Why are you lining up for battle?

Choose someone to fight me!</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-17-11" id="en-CEV-6426"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Saul and his men heard what Goliath said, but they were so frightened of Goliath that they couldn't do a thing.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 1Sam-17-12" id="en-CEV-6427">David Decides To Challenge Goliath</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Sam-17-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>David's father Jesse was an old man, who belonged to the Ephrath clan and lived in Bethlehem in Judah. Jesse had eight sons: </span> <span class="text 1Sam-17-13-1Sam-17-14" id="en-CEV-6428"><sup class="versenum">13-14 </sup>the oldest was Eliab, the next was Abinadab, and Shammah was the third. The three of them had gone off to fight in Saul's army.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-17-13-1Sam-17-14">David was Jesse's youngest son. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-17-15" id="en-CEV-6429"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup> He took care of his father's sheep, and he went back and forth between Bethlehem and Saul's camp.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-17-16" id="en-CEV-6430"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Goliath came out and gave his challenge every morning and every evening for 40 days.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-17-17" id="en-CEV-6431"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>One day, Jesse told David, “Hurry and take this sack of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread to your brothers at the army camp. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-17-18" id="en-CEV-6432"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>And here are ten large chunks of cheese to take to their commanding officer. Find out how your brothers are doing and bring back something that shows that they're all right. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-17-19" id="en-CEV-6433"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>They're with Saul's army, fighting the Philistines in Elah Valley.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-17-20" id="en-CEV-6434"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>David obeyed his father. He got up early the next morning and left someone else in charge of the sheep; then he loaded the supplies and started off. He reached the army camp just as the soldiers were taking their places and shouting the battle cry. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-17-21" id="en-CEV-6435"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>The army of Israel and the Philistine army stood there facing each other.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-17-22" id="en-CEV-6436"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>David left his things with the man in charge of supplies and ran up to the battle line to ask his brothers if they were well. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-17-23" id="en-CEV-6437"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>While David was talking with them, Goliath came out from the line of Philistines and started boasting as usual. David heard him.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-17-24" id="en-CEV-6438"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>When the Israelite soldiers saw Goliath, they were scared and ran off. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-17-25" id="en-CEV-6439"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>They said to each other, “Look how he keeps coming out to insult us. The king is offering a big reward to the man who kills Goliath. That man will even get to marry the king's daughter, and no one in his family will ever have to pay taxes again.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-17-26" id="en-CEV-6440"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>David asked some soldiers standing nearby, “What will a man get for killing this Philistine and stopping him from insulting our people? Who does that worthless Philistine think he is? He's making fun of the army of the living God!”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-17-27" id="en-CEV-6441"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>The soldiers told David what the king would give the man who killed Goliath.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-17-28" id="en-CEV-6442"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>David's oldest brother Eliab heard him talking with the soldiers. Eliab was angry with him and said, “What are you doing here, anyway? Who's taking care of your little flock of sheep out in the desert? You spoiled brat! You came here just to watch the fighting, didn't you?”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-17-29" id="en-CEV-6443"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>“Now what have I done?” David answered. “Can't I even ask a question?” </span> <span class="text 1Sam-17-30" id="en-CEV-6444"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>Then he turned and asked another soldier the same thing he had asked the others, and he got the same answer.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-17-31" id="en-CEV-6445"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>Some soldiers overheard David talking, so they told Saul what David had said. Saul sent for David, and David came. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-17-32" id="en-CEV-6446"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>“Your Majesty,” he said, “this Philistine shouldn't turn us into cowards. I'll go out and fight him myself!”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-17-33" id="en-CEV-6447"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>“You don't have a chance against him,” Saul replied. “You're only a boy, and he's been a soldier all his life.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-17-34" id="en-CEV-6448"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>But David told him:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Sam-17-34">Your Majesty, I take care of my father's sheep. And when one of them is dragged off by a lion or a bear, </span> <span class="text 1Sam-17-35" id="en-CEV-6449"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>I go after it and beat the wild animal until it lets the sheep go. If the wild animal turns and attacks me, I grab it by the throat and kill it.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Sam-17-36" id="en-CEV-6450"><sup class="versenum">36 </sup>Sir, I have killed lions and bears that way, and I can kill this worthless Philistine. He shouldn't have made fun of the army of the living God! </span> <span class="text 1Sam-17-37" id="en-CEV-6451"><sup class="versenum">37 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has rescued me from the claws of lions and bears, and he will keep me safe from the hands of this Philistine.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-17-37">“All right,” Saul answered, “go ahead and fight him. And I hope the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will help you.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-17-38" id="en-CEV-6452"><sup class="versenum">38 </sup>Saul had his own military clothes and armor put on David, and he gave David a bronze helmet to wear. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-17-39" id="en-CEV-6453"><sup class="versenum">39 </sup>David strapped on a sword and tried to walk around, but he was not used to wearing those things.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-17-39">“I can't move with all this stuff on,” David said. “I'm just not used to it.”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-17-39">David took off the armor </span> <span class="text 1Sam-17-40" id="en-CEV-6454"><sup class="versenum">40 </sup>and picked up his shepherd's stick. He went out to a stream and picked up five smooth rocks and put them in his leather bag. Then with his sling in his hand, he went straight toward Goliath.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 1Sam-17-41" id="en-CEV-6455">David Kills Goliath</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Sam-17-41"><sup class="versenum">41 </sup>Goliath came toward David, walking behind the soldier who was carrying his shield. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-17-42" id="en-CEV-6456"><sup class="versenum">42 </sup>When Goliath saw that David was just a healthy, good-looking boy, he made fun of him. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-17-43" id="en-CEV-6457"><sup class="versenum">43 </sup> “Do you think I'm a dog?” Goliath asked. “Is that why you've come after me with a stick?” He cursed David in the name of the Philistine gods </span> <span class="text 1Sam-17-44" id="en-CEV-6458"><sup class="versenum">44 </sup>and shouted, “Come on! When I'm finished with you, I'll feed you to the birds and wild animals!”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-17-45" id="en-CEV-6459"><sup class="versenum">45 </sup>David answered:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Sam-17-45">You've come out to fight me with a sword and a spear and a dagger. But I've come out to fight you in the name of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> All-Powerful.

When he let go of one strap, the rock flew out and hit Goliath on the forehead. It cracked his skull, and he fell facedown on the ground. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-17-50" id="en-CEV-6464"><sup class="versenum">50 </sup> David defeated Goliath with a sling and a rock.
