<h3><span class="text 1Sam-20-1" id="en-CEV-6523">Jonathan Helps David Escape</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text 1Sam-20-1"><span class="chapternum">20 </span>David escaped from Prophets Village. Then he ran to see Jonathan and asked, “Why does your father Saul want to kill me? What have I done wrong?”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-20-2" id="en-CEV-6524"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>“My father can't be trying to kill you! He never does anything without telling me about it. Why would he hide this from me? It can't be true!”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-20-3" id="en-CEV-6525"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>“Jonathan, I swear it's true! But your father knows how much you like me, and he didn't want to break your heart. That's why he didn't tell you. I swear by the living <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> and by your own life that I'm only one step ahead of death.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-20-4" id="en-CEV-6526"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Then Jonathan said, “Tell me what to do, and I'll do it.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-20-5" id="en-CEV-6527"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup> David answered:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Sam-20-5">Tomorrow is the New Moon Festival,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-6527a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-6527a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-6527a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> and I'm supposed to eat dinner with your father. But instead, I'll hide in a field until the evening of the next day. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-20-6" id="en-CEV-6528"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>If Saul wonders where I am, tell him, “David asked me to let him go to his hometown of Bethlehem, so he could take part in a sacrifice his family makes there every year.”</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Sam-20-7" id="en-CEV-6529"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>If your father says it's all right, then I'm safe. But if he gets angry, you'll know he wants to harm me. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-20-8" id="en-CEV-6530"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Be kind to me. After all, it was your idea to promise the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> that we would always be loyal friends. If I've done anything wrong, kill me yourself, but don't hand me over to your father.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-20-9" id="en-CEV-6531"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>“Don't worry,” Jonathan said. “If I find out that my father wants to kill you, I'll certainly let you know.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-20-10" id="en-CEV-6532"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>“How will you do that?” David asked.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-20-11" id="en-CEV-6533"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>“Let's go out to this field, and I'll tell you,” Jonathan answered.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-20-11">When they got there, </span> <span class="text 1Sam-20-12" id="en-CEV-6534"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Jonathan said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Sam-20-12">I swear by the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God of Israel, that two days from now I'll know what my father is planning. Of course I'll let you know if he's friendly toward you. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-20-13" id="en-CEV-6535"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>But if he wants to harm you, I promise to tell you and help you escape. And I ask the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> to punish me severely if I don't keep my promise.</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Sam-20-13">I pray that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will bless you, just as he used to bless my father. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-20-14-1Sam-20-15" id="en-CEV-6536"><sup class="versenum">14-15 </sup> Someday the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will wipe out all of your enemies.

Pick them up!” </span> <span class="text 1Sam-20-22" id="en-CEV-6543"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>But if it isn't safe, I'll say to the boy, “The arrows are farther away!” This will mean that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> wants you to leave, and you must go. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-20-23" id="en-CEV-6544"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>But he will always watch us to make sure that we keep the promise we made to each other.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-20-24" id="en-CEV-6545"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>So David hid there in the field.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-20-24">During the New Moon Festival, Saul sat down to eat </span> <span class="text 1Sam-20-25" id="en-CEV-6546"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>by the wall, just as he always did.

But David's place was empty. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-20-26" id="en-CEV-6547"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>Saul didn't say anything that day, because he was thinking, “Something must have happened to make David unfit to be at the Festival.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-6547g" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-6547g" title="See footnote g"&gt;g&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-6547g" title="See footnote g">g</a>]</sup> Yes, something must have happened.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-20-27" id="en-CEV-6548"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>The day after the New Moon Festival, when David's place was still empty, Saul asked Jonathan, “Why hasn't that son of Jesse come to eat with us?

He said, ‘Please let me go. My family is offering a sacrifice, and my brother told me I have to be there. Do me this favor and let me slip away to see my brothers.’ ”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-20-30" id="en-CEV-6550"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>Saul was furious with Jonathan and yelled, “You're no son of mine, you traitor! I know you've chosen to be loyal to that son of Jesse. You should be ashamed of yourself! And your own mother should be ashamed that you were ever born. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-20-31" id="en-CEV-6551"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>You'll never be safe, and your kingdom will be in danger as long as that son of Jesse is alive.

He deserves to die!”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-20-32" id="en-CEV-6552"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>“Why do you want to kill David?” Jonathan asked. “What has he done?”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Sam-20-33" id="en-CEV-6553"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>Saul threw his spear at Jonathan and tried to kill him. Then Jonathan was sure that his father really did want to kill David. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-20-34" id="en-CEV-6554"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>Jonathan was angry and hurt that his father had insulted David<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-6554h" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-6554h" title="See footnote h"&gt;h&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-6554h" title="See footnote h">h</a>]</sup> so terribly.

He took a servant boy along </span> <span class="text 1Sam-20-36" id="en-CEV-6556"><sup class="versenum">36 </sup>and told him, “When I shoot the arrows, you run and find them for me.”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-20-36">The boy started running, and Jonathan shot an arrow so that it would go beyond him. </span> <span class="text 1Sam-20-37" id="en-CEV-6557"><sup class="versenum">37 </sup>When the boy got near the place where the arrow had landed, Jonathan shouted, “Isn't the arrow on past you?” </span> <span class="text 1Sam-20-38" id="en-CEV-6558"><sup class="versenum">38 </sup>Jonathan shouted to him again, “Hurry up! Don't stop!”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-20-38">The boy picked up the arrows and brought them back to Jonathan, </span> <span class="text 1Sam-20-39" id="en-CEV-6559"><sup class="versenum">39 </sup>but he had no idea about what was going on.
