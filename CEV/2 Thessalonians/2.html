They may say they heard this directly from the Holy Spirit, or from someone else, or even that they read it in one of our letters. </span> <span class="text 2Thess-2-3" id="en-CEV-27552"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>But don't be fooled! People will rebel against God. Then before the Lord returns, the wicked<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27552b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27552b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27552b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> one who is doomed to be destroyed will appear. </span> <span class="text 2Thess-2-4" id="en-CEV-27553"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup> He will brag and oppose everything holy or sacred.
