Take the army and attack again. But first, order part of the army to set up an ambush on the other side of the town. I will help you defeat the king of Ai and his army, and you will capture the town and the land around it. Destroy Ai and kill its king as you did at Jericho. But you may keep the livestock and everything else you want.</span></p> <p><span class="text Josh-8-3-Josh-8-4" id="en-CEV-5093"><sup class="versenum">3-4 </sup>Joshua quickly got the army ready to attack Ai.
