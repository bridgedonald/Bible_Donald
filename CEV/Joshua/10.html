He also learned that the Gibeonites had signed a peace treaty with Israel. </span> <span class="text Josh-10-2" id="en-CEV-5136"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>This frightened Adonizedek and his people. They knew that Gibeon was a large town, as big as the towns that had kings, and even bigger than the town of Ai had been. And all of the men of Gibeon were warriors. </span> <span class="text Josh-10-3" id="en-CEV-5137"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>So Adonizedek sent messages to the kings of four other towns: King Hoham of Hebron, King Piram of Jarmuth, King Japhia of Lachish, and King Debir of Eglon.
