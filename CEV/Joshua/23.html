<h3><span class="text Josh-23-1" id="en-CEV-5367">Joshua's Farewell Speech</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Josh-23-1"><span class="chapternum">23 </span>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> let Israel live in peace with its neighbors for a long time, and Joshua lived to a ripe old age. </span> <span class="text Josh-23-2" id="en-CEV-5368"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>One day he called a meeting of the leaders of the tribes of Israel, including the old men, the judges, and the officials. Then he told them:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Josh-23-2">I am now very old. </span> <span class="text Josh-23-3" id="en-CEV-5369"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>You have seen how the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> your God fought for you and helped you defeat the nations who lived in this land. </span> <span class="text Josh-23-4-Josh-23-5" id="en-CEV-5370"><sup class="versenum">4-5 </sup>There are still some nations left, but the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has promised you their land. So when you attack them, he will make them run away. I have already divided their land among your tribes, as I did with the land of the nations I defeated between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Josh-23-6" id="en-CEV-5371"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Be sure that you carefully obey everything written in <i>The Book of the Law</i><sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5371a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5371a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5371a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> of Moses and do exactly what it says.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Josh-23-7" id="en-CEV-5372"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Don't have anything to do with the nations that live around you. Don't worship their gods or pray to their idols or make promises in the names of their gods. </span> <span class="text Josh-23-8" id="en-CEV-5373"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Be as faithful to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> as you have always been.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Josh-23-9" id="en-CEV-5374"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>When you attacked powerful nations, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> made them run away, and no one has ever been able to stand up to you. </span> <span class="text Josh-23-10" id="en-CEV-5375"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup> Any one of you can defeat a thousand enemy soldiers, because the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God fights for you, just as he promised. </span> <span class="text Josh-23-11" id="en-CEV-5376"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Be sure to always love the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> your God. </span> <span class="text Josh-23-12-Josh-23-13" id="en-CEV-5377"><sup class="versenum">12-13 </sup>Don't ever turn your backs on him by marrying people from the nations that are left in the land. Don't even make friends with them. I tell you that if you are friendly with those nations, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> won't chase them away when you attack. Instead, they'll be like a trap for your feet, a whip on your back, and thorns in your eyes. And finally, none of you will be left in this good land that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has given you.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Josh-23-14" id="en-CEV-5378"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>I will soon die, as everyone must. But deep in your hearts you know that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has kept every promise he ever made to you. Not one of them has been broken. </span> <span class="text Josh-23-15-Josh-23-16" id="en-CEV-5379"><sup class="versenum">15-16 </sup>Yes, when the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> makes a promise, he does what he has promised. But when he makes a threat, he will also do what he has threatened. The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> is our God. He gave us this wonderful land and made an agreement with us that we would worship only him. But if you worship other gods, it will make the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> furious. He will start getting rid of you, and soon not one of you will be left in this good land that he has given you.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
