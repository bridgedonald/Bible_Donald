Machir had a son named Gilead, and some of his descendants had already received the regions of Gilead and Bashan because they were good warriors. The other clans of the Manasseh tribe descended from Gilead's sons Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida. The following is a description of the land they received.</span></p><p><span class="text Josh-17-1-Josh-17-6">Hepher's son Zelophehad did not have any sons, but he did have five daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. One day the clans that were descendants of Zelophehad's five daughters went to the priest Eleazar, Joshua, and the leaders of Israel. The people of these clans said, “The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> told Moses to give us land just as he gave land to our relatives.”<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5270a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5270a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5270a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></span></p><p><span class="text Josh-17-1-Josh-17-6">Joshua followed the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s instructions and gave land to these five clans, as he had given land to the five clans that had descended from Hepher's brothers.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5270b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5270b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5270b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> So Manasseh's land west of the Jordan River was divided into ten parts.</span></p> <p><span class="text Josh-17-7" id="en-CEV-5271"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>The land of the Manasseh tribe went from its northern border with the Asher tribe south to Michmethath, which is to the east of Shechem.
