The Jabbok River separated Sihon's kingdom from the Ammonites on the east. Then the Jabbok turned west and became his northern border, so his kingdom included the southern half of the region of Gilead. </span> <span class="text Josh-12-3" id="en-CEV-5194"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Sihon also controlled the eastern side of the Jordan River valley from Lake Galilee<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5194b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5194b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5194b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> south to Beth-Jeshimoth and the Dead Sea.

This region included the hill country and the foothills, the Jordan River valley and its western slopes, and the Southern Desert. Joshua and the Israelites took this land from the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. Joshua divided up the land among the tribes of Israel.</span></p><p><span class="text Josh-12-7-Josh-12-8">The Israelites defeated the kings of the following towns west of the Jordan River:</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Josh-12-9-Josh-12-24" id="en-CEV-5199"><sup class="versenum">9-24 </sup>Jericho, Ai near Bethel, Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, Eglon, Gezer, Debir, Geder, Hormah, Arad, Libnah, Adullam, Makkedah, Bethel, Tappuah, Hepher, Aphek, Lasharon,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5199f" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5199f" title="See footnote f"&gt;f&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5199f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> Madon, Hazor, Shimron-Meron, Achshaph, Taanach, Megiddo, Kedesh, Jokneam on Mount Carmel, Dor in Naphath-Dor, Goiim in Galilee,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5199g" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5199g" title="See footnote g"&gt;g&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5199g" title="See footnote g">g</a>]</sup> and Tirzah.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5199h" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5199h" title="See footnote h"&gt;h&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5199h" title="See footnote h">h</a>]</sup></span></p><p class="first-line-none"><span class="text Josh-12-9-Josh-12-24">There were 31 of these kings in all.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
