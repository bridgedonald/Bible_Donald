<h3><span class="text Josh-24-1" id="en-CEV-5380">We Will Worship and Obey the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Josh-24-1"><span class="chapternum">24 </span>Joshua called the tribes of Israel together for a meeting at Shechem. He asked the leaders, including the old men, the judges, and the officials, to come up and stand near the sacred tent.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5380a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5380a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5380a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Josh-24-2" id="en-CEV-5381"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup> Then Joshua told everyone to listen to this message from the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Josh-24-2">Long ago your ancestors lived on the other side of the Euphrates River, and they worshiped other gods. This continued until the time of your ancestor Terah and his two sons, Abraham and Nahor. </span> <span class="text Josh-24-3" id="en-CEV-5382"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup> But I brought Abraham across the Euphrates River and led him through the land of Canaan. I blessed him by giving him Isaac, the first in a line of many descendants. </span> <span class="text Josh-24-4" id="en-CEV-5383"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup> Then I gave Isaac two sons, Jacob and Esau. I gave Esau the hill country of Mount Seir, but your ancestor Jacob and his children went to live in Egypt.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Josh-24-5-Josh-24-6" id="en-CEV-5384"><sup class="versenum">5-6 </sup> Later I sent Moses and his brother Aaron to help your people, and I made all those horrible things happen to the Egyptians. I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, but the Egyptians got in their chariots and on their horses and chased your ancestors, catching up with them at the Red Sea.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5384b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5384b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5384b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Josh-24-7" id="en-CEV-5385"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Your people cried to me for help, so I put a dark cloud between them and the Egyptians. Then I opened up the sea and let your people walk across on dry ground. But when the Egyptians tried to follow, I commanded the sea to swallow them, and they drowned while you watched.</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Josh-24-7">You lived in the desert for a long time, </span> <span class="text Josh-24-8" id="en-CEV-5386"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup> then I brought you into the land east of the Jordan River. The Amorites were living there, and they fought you. But with my help, you defeated them, wiped them out, and took their land. </span> <span class="text Josh-24-9" id="en-CEV-5387"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup> King Balak decided that his nation Moab would go to war against you, so he asked Balaam<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5387c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5387c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5387c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> to come and put a curse on you. </span> <span class="text Josh-24-10" id="en-CEV-5388"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>But I wouldn't listen to Balaam, and I rescued you by making him bless you instead of curse you.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Josh-24-11" id="en-CEV-5389"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup> You crossed the Jordan River and came to Jericho. The rulers of Jericho fought you, and so did the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. I helped you defeat them all. </span> <span class="text Josh-24-12" id="en-CEV-5390"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup> Your enemies ran from you, but not because you had swords and bows and arrows. I made your enemies panic and run away, as I had done with the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan River.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Josh-24-13" id="en-CEV-5391"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup> You didn't have to work for this land—I gave it to you. Now you live in towns you didn't build, and you eat grapes and olives from vineyards and trees you didn't plant.</span></p> <p><span class="text Josh-24-14" id="en-CEV-5392"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Then Joshua told the people:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Josh-24-14">Worship the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, obey him, and always be faithful. Get rid of the idols your ancestors worshiped when they lived on the other side of the Euphrates River and in Egypt. </span> <span class="text Josh-24-15" id="en-CEV-5393"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>But if you don't want to worship the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, then choose here and now! Will you worship the same idols your ancestors did? Or since you're living on land that once belonged to the Amorites, maybe you'll worship their gods. I won't. My family and I are going to worship and obey the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>!</span></p> <p><span class="text Josh-24-16" id="en-CEV-5394"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>The people answered:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Josh-24-16">We could never worship other gods or stop worshiping the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>. </span> <span class="text Josh-24-17" id="en-CEV-5395"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> is our God. We were slaves in Egypt as our ancestors had been, but we saw the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> work miracles to set our people free and to bring us out of Egypt. Even though other nations were all around us, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> protected us wherever we went. </span> <span class="text Josh-24-18" id="en-CEV-5396"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>And when we fought the Amorites and the other nations that lived in this land, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> made them run away. Yes, we will worship and obey the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, because the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> is our God.</span></p> <p><span class="text Josh-24-19" id="en-CEV-5397"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Joshua said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Josh-24-19">The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> is fearsome; he is the one true God, and I don't think you are able to worship and obey him in the ways he demands. You would have to be completely faithful, and if you sin or rebel, he won't let you get away with it. </span> <span class="text Josh-24-20" id="en-CEV-5398"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>If you turn your backs on the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> and worship the gods of other nations, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will turn against you. He will make terrible things happen to you and wipe you out, even though he had been good to you before.</span></p> <p><span class="text Josh-24-21" id="en-CEV-5399"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>But the people shouted, “We won't worship any other gods. We will worship and obey only the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Josh-24-22" id="en-CEV-5400"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Joshua said, “You have heard yourselves say that you will worship and obey the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>. Isn't that true?”</span></p><p><span class="text Josh-24-22">“Yes, it's true,” they answered.</span></p> <p><span class="text Josh-24-23" id="en-CEV-5401"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>Joshua said, “But you still have some idols, like those the other nations worship. Get rid of your idols! You must decide once and for all that you really want to obey the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God of Israel.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Josh-24-24" id="en-CEV-5402"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>The people said, “The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> is our God, and we will worship and obey only him.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Josh-24-25" id="en-CEV-5403"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Joshua helped Israel make an agreement with the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> that day at Shechem.
