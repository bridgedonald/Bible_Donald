You've never been there before, and you won't know the way, unless you follow the chest. But don't get too close!

And now, God is going to prove that he's powerful enough to force them out. </span> <span class="text Josh-3-11-Josh-3-13" id="en-CEV-5023"><sup class="versenum">11-13 </sup>Just watch the sacred chest that belongs to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, the ruler of the whole earth.
