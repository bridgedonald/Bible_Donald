They are spies.”</span></p><p><span class="text Josh-2-3-Josh-2-7">She answered, “Some men did come to my house, but I didn't know where they had come from. They left about sunset, just before it was time to close the town gate.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-4999c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-4999c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-4999c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> I don't know where they were going, but if you hurry, maybe you can catch them.”</span></p><p><span class="text Josh-2-3-Josh-2-7">The guards at the town gate let the soldiers leave Jericho, but they closed the gate again as soon as the soldiers went through. Then the soldiers headed toward the Jordan River to look for the spies at the place where people cross the river.</span></p> <p><span class="text Josh-2-8" id="en-CEV-5000"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Rahab went back up to her roof. The spies were still awake, so she told them:</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Josh-2-9" id="en-CEV-5001"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>I know that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has given Israel this land.

And we heard how you destroyed Sihon and Og, those two Amorite kings east of the Jordan River. </span> <span class="text Josh-2-11" id="en-CEV-5003"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>We know that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> your God rules heaven and earth, and we've lost our courage and our will to fight.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Josh-2-12" id="en-CEV-5004"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Please promise me in the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s name that you will be as kind to my family as I have been to you.

She gave the spies a rope, showed them the window, and said, “Use this rope to let yourselves down to the ground outside the wall. </span> <span class="text Josh-2-16" id="en-CEV-5008"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Then hide in the hills. The men who are looking for you won't be able to find you there.

We will keep our promise, but you can't tell anyone why we were here. You must tie this red rope on your window when we attack, and your father and mother, your brothers, and everyone else in your family must be here with you. We'll take the blame if anyone who stays in this house gets hurt. But anyone who leaves your house will be killed, and it won't be our fault.</span></p> <p><span class="text Josh-2-21" id="en-CEV-5010"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>“I'll do exactly what you said,” Rahab promised.
