<p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Josh-6-1" id="en-CEV-5052"><span class="chapternum">6 </span>Meanwhile, the people of Jericho had been locking the gates in their town wall because they were afraid of the Israelites. No one could go out or come in.</span></p> <p><span class="text Josh-6-2-Josh-6-3" id="en-CEV-5053"><sup class="versenum">2-3 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to Joshua:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Josh-6-2-Josh-6-3">With my help, you and your army will defeat the king of Jericho and his army, and you will capture the town. Here is how to do it: March slowly around Jericho once a day for six days. </span> <span class="text Josh-6-4" id="en-CEV-5054"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Take along the sacred chest and tell seven priests to walk in front of it, carrying trumpets.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-5054a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-5054a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-5054a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Josh-6-4">But on the seventh day, march slowly around the town seven times while the priests blow their trumpets. </span> <span class="text Josh-6-5" id="en-CEV-5055"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Then the priests will blast on their trumpets, and everyone else will shout. The wall will fall down, and your soldiers can go straight in from every side.</span></p> <p><span class="text Josh-6-6" id="en-CEV-5056"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Joshua called the priests together and said, “Take the chest and tell seven priests to carry trumpets and march ahead of it.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Josh-6-7-Josh-6-10" id="en-CEV-5057"><sup class="versenum">7-10 </sup>Next, he gave the army their orders: “March slowly around Jericho. A few of you will go ahead of the chest to guard it, but most of you will follow it. Don't shout the battle cry or yell or even talk until the day I tell you to. Then let out a shout!”</span></p><p><span class="text Josh-6-7-Josh-6-10">As soon as Joshua finished giving the orders, the army started marching. One group of soldiers led the way, with seven priests marching behind them and blowing trumpets. Then came the priests carrying the chest, followed by the rest of the soldiers. </span> <span class="text Josh-6-11" id="en-CEV-5058"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>They obeyed Joshua's orders and carried the chest once around the town before returning to camp for the night.</span></p> <p><span class="text Josh-6-12-Josh-6-14" id="en-CEV-5059"><sup class="versenum">12-14 </sup>Early the next morning, Joshua and everyone else started marching around Jericho in the same order as the day before. One group of soldiers was in front, followed by the seven priests with trumpets and the priests who carried the chest. The rest of the army came next. The seven priests blew their trumpets while everyone marched slowly around Jericho and back to camp. They did this once a day for six days.</span></p> <p><span class="text Josh-6-15" id="en-CEV-5060"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>On the seventh day, the army got up at daybreak. They marched slowly around Jericho the same as they had done for the past six days, except on this day they went around seven times. </span> <span class="text Josh-6-16" id="en-CEV-5061"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Then the priests blew the trumpets, and Joshua yelled:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Josh-6-16">Get ready to shout!
