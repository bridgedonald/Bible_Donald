The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will be with you and help you, as long as you obey and worship him. But if you disobey him, he will desert you.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text 2Chr-15-3" id="en-CEV-9881"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>For a long time, the people of Israel did not worship the true God or listen to priests who could teach them about God.

Don't give up! God will honor you for obeying him.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Chr-15-8" id="en-CEV-9886"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>As soon as Asa heard what Azariah the prophet said, he gave orders for all the idols in Judah and Benjamin to be destroyed, including those in the towns he had captured in the territory of Ephraim. He also repaired the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s altar that was in front of the temple porch.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Chr-15-9" id="en-CEV-9887"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Asa called together the people from Judah and Benjamin, as well as the people from the territories of Ephraim, West Manasseh, and Simeon who were living in Judah. Many of these people were now loyal to Asa, because they had seen that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> was with him.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Chr-15-10" id="en-CEV-9888"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>In the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa's rule, they all met in Jerusalem. </span> <span class="text 2Chr-15-11" id="en-CEV-9889"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>That same day, they took 700 bulls and 7,000 sheep and goats from what they had brought back from Gerar and sacrificed them as offerings to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>. </span> <span class="text 2Chr-15-12" id="en-CEV-9890"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>They made a solemn promise to faithfully worship the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God their ancestors had worshiped, </span> <span class="text 2Chr-15-13" id="en-CEV-9891"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>and to put to death anyone who refused to obey him. </span> <span class="text 2Chr-15-14" id="en-CEV-9892"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>The crowd solemnly agreed to keep their promise to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, then they celebrated by shouting and blowing trumpets and horns. </span> <span class="text 2Chr-15-15" id="en-CEV-9893"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Everyone was happy because they had made this solemn promise, and in return, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> blessed them with peace from all their enemies.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Chr-15-16" id="en-CEV-9894"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Asa's grandmother Maacah had made a disgusting idol of the goddess Asherah, so he cut it down, crushed it, and burned it in Kidron Valley.
