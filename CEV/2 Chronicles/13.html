His mother was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel from Gibeah.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Chr-13-2">Some time later, Abijah and King Jeroboam of Israel went to war against each other. </span> <span class="text 2Chr-13-3" id="en-CEV-9844"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Abijah's army had 400,000 troops, and Jeroboam met him in battle with 800,000 troops.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Chr-13-4" id="en-CEV-9845"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Abijah went to the top of Mount Zemaraim<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-9845b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-9845b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-9845b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> in the hills of Ephraim and shouted:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 2Chr-13-4">Listen, Jeroboam and all you Israelites! </span> <span class="text 2Chr-13-5" id="en-CEV-9846"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God of Israel has made a solemn promise that every king of Israel will be from David's family. </span> <span class="text 2Chr-13-6" id="en-CEV-9847"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>But Jeroboam, you were King Solomon's official, and you rebelled. </span> <span class="text 2Chr-13-7" id="en-CEV-9848"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Then right after Rehoboam became king, you and your bunch of worthless followers challenged Rehoboam, who was too young to know how to stop you.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text 2Chr-13-8" id="en-CEV-9849"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Now you and your powerful army think you can stand up to the kingdom that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has given to David's descendants.

In their place, you appoint ordinary people to be priests, just as the foreign nations do. In fact, anyone who brings a bull and seven rams to the altar can become a priest of your so-called gods.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text 2Chr-13-10" id="en-CEV-9851"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>But we have not turned our backs on the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God!

They set out the sacred loaves of bread on a table that has been purified, and they light the lamps in the gold lampstand every day at sunset. We follow the commands of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> our God—you have rejected him! </span> <span class="text 2Chr-13-12" id="en-CEV-9853"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>That's why God is on our side and will lead us into battle when the priests sound the signal on the trumpets. It's no use, Israelites. You might as well give up. There's no way you can defeat the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, the God your ancestors worshiped.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Chr-13-13" id="en-CEV-9854"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>But while Abijah was talking, Jeroboam had sent some of his troops to attack Judah's army from behind, while the rest attacked from the front. </span> <span class="text 2Chr-13-14" id="en-CEV-9855"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Judah's army realized they were trapped, and so they prayed to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>.
