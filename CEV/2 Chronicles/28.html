He made idols of the god Baal, </span> <span class="text 2Chr-28-3" id="en-CEV-10148"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>and he offered sacrifices in Hinnom Valley. Worst of all, Ahaz sacrificed his own sons, which was a disgusting custom of the nations that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had forced out of Israel. </span> <span class="text 2Chr-28-4" id="en-CEV-10149"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Ahaz offered sacrifices at the local shrines,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-10149a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-10149a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-10149a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> as well as on every hill and in the shade of large trees.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 2Chr-28-5-2Chr-28-6" id="en-CEV-10150">Syria and Israel Attack Judah</span></h3><h4 class="reference"><span class="text 2Chr-28-5-2Chr-28-6">(<a class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Kgs.16.5" href="/passage/?search=2Kgs.16.5&amp;version=CEV">2 Kings 16.5</a>,<a class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Kgs.16.6" href="/passage/?search=2Kgs.16.6&amp;version=CEV">6</a>)</span></h4><p><span class="text 2Chr-28-5-2Chr-28-6"><sup class="versenum">5-6 </sup> Ahaz and the people of Judah sinned and turned away from the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, the God their ancestors had worshiped.

They did these things even though the people of Judah were their own relatives.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 2Chr-28-9" id="en-CEV-10153">Oded the Prophet Condemns Israel</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-28-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Oded lived in Samaria and was one of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s prophets. He met Israel's army on their way back from Judah and said to them:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 2Chr-28-9">The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God of your ancestors let you defeat Judah's army only because he was angry with them. But you should not have been so cruel! </span> <span class="text 2Chr-28-10" id="en-CEV-10154"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>If you make slaves of the people of Judah and Jerusalem, you will be as guilty as they are of sinning against the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text 2Chr-28-11" id="en-CEV-10155"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Send these prisoners back home—they are your own relatives.

They were Azariah son of Johanan, Berechiah son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai. They agreed with Oded that the Israelite troops were wrong, </span> <span class="text 2Chr-28-13" id="en-CEV-10157"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>and they said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 2Chr-28-13">If you bring these prisoners into Samaria, that will be one more thing we've done to sin against the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>. And he is already angry enough with us.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Chr-28-14" id="en-CEV-10158"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>So in front of the leaders and the crowd, the troops handed over their prisoners and the property they had taken from Judah. </span> <span class="text 2Chr-28-15" id="en-CEV-10159"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>The four leaders took some of the stolen clothes and gave them to the prisoners who needed something to wear. They later gave them all a new change of clothes and shoes, then fixed them something to eat and drink, and cleaned their wounds with olive oil. They gave donkeys to those who were too weak to walk, and led all of them back to Jericho, the city known for its palm trees. The leaders then returned to Samaria.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 2Chr-28-16-2Chr-28-18" id="en-CEV-10160">Ahaz Asks the King of Assyria for Help</span></h3><h4 class="reference"><span class="text 2Chr-28-16-2Chr-28-18">(<a class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Kgs.16.7-2Kgs.16.9" href="/passage/?search=2Kgs.16.7-2Kgs.16.9&amp;version=CEV">2 Kings 16.7-9</a>)</span></h4><p><span class="text 2Chr-28-16-2Chr-28-18"><sup class="versenum">16-18 </sup>Some time later, the Edomites attacked the eastern part of Judah again and carried away prisoners. And at the same time, the Philistines raided towns in the western foothills and in the Southern Desert. They conquered the towns of Beth-Shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Soco, Timnah, and Gimzo, including the villages around them. Then some of the Philistines went to live in these places.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Chr-28-16-2Chr-28-18">Ahaz sent a message to King Tiglath Pileser of Assyria and begged for help. </span> <span class="text 2Chr-28-19" id="en-CEV-10161"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>But God was punishing Judah with these disasters, because Ahaz had disobeyed him and refused to stop Judah from sinning. </span> <span class="text 2Chr-28-20" id="en-CEV-10162"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>So Tiglath Pileser came to Judah, but instead of helping, he made things worse. </span> <span class="text 2Chr-28-21" id="en-CEV-10163"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Ahaz gave him gifts from the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s temple and the king's palace, as well as from the homes of Israel's other leaders. The Assyrian king still refused to help Ahaz.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 2Chr-28-22" id="en-CEV-10164">The Final Sin of Ahaz and His Death</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-28-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Even after all these terrible things happened to Ahaz, he sinned against the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> even worse than before. </span> <span class="text 2Chr-28-23" id="en-CEV-10165"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>He said to himself, “The Syrian gods must have helped their kings defeat me. Maybe if I offer sacrifices to those gods, they will help me.” That was the sin that finally led to the downfall of Ahaz, as well as to the destruction of Judah.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Chr-28-24" id="en-CEV-10166"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>Ahaz collected all the furnishings of the temple and smashed them to pieces. Then he locked the doors to the temple and set up altars to foreign gods on every street corner in Jerusalem. </span> <span class="text 2Chr-28-25" id="en-CEV-10167"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>In every city and town in Judah he built local shrines<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-10167c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-10167c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-10167c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> to worship foreign gods.

His son Hezekiah then became king.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
