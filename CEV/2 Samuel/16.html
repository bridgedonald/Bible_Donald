<h3><span class="text 2Sam-16-1" id="en-CEV-7177">Ziba Gives Food to David</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text 2Sam-16-1"><span class="chapternum">16 </span> David had started down the other side of the Mount of Olives, when he was met by Ziba, the chief servant of Mephibosheth.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-7177a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-7177a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-7177a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> Ziba had two donkeys that were carrying 200 loaves of bread, 100 handfuls of raisins, 100 figs,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-7177b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-7177b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-7177b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> and some wine.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-16-2" id="en-CEV-7178"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>“What's all this?” David asked.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-16-2">Ziba said, “The donkeys are for your family to ride. The bread and fruit are for the people to eat, and the wine is for them to drink in the desert when they are tired out.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-16-3" id="en-CEV-7179"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup> “And where is Mephibosheth?” David asked.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-16-3">Ziba answered, “He stayed in Jerusalem, because he thinks the people of Israel want him to rule the kingdom of his grandfather Saul.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-16-4" id="en-CEV-7180"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>David then told him, “Everything that used to belong to Mephibosheth is now yours.”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-16-4">Ziba said, “Your Majesty, I am your humble servant, and I hope you will be pleased with me.”</span></p> <h3><span class="text 2Sam-16-5" id="en-CEV-7181">Shimei Curses David</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-16-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>David was near the town of Bahurim when a man came out and started cursing him. The man was Shimei the son of Gera, and he was one of Saul's distant relatives. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-16-6" id="en-CEV-7182"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>He threw stones at David, at his soldiers, and at everyone else, including the bodyguards who walked on each side of David.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-16-7" id="en-CEV-7183"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Shimei was yelling at David, “Get out of here, you murderer! You good-for-nothing, </span> <span class="text 2Sam-16-8" id="en-CEV-7184"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> is paying you back for killing so many in Saul's family. You stole his kingdom, but now the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has given it to your son Absalom. You're a murderer, and that's why you're in such big trouble!”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-16-9" id="en-CEV-7185"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Abishai said, “Your Majesty, this man is as useless as a dead dog! He shouldn't be allowed to curse you. Let me go over and chop off his head.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-16-10" id="en-CEV-7186"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>David replied, “What will I ever do with you and your brother Joab? If Shimei is cursing me because the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has told him to, then who are you to tell him to stop?”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-16-11" id="en-CEV-7187"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Then David said to Abishai and all his soldiers:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 2Sam-16-11">My own son is trying to kill me! Why shouldn't this man from the tribe of Benjamin want me dead even more? Let him curse all he wants. Maybe the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> did tell him to curse me. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-16-12" id="en-CEV-7188"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>But if the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> hears these curses and sees the trouble I'm in, maybe he will have pity on me instead.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-16-13" id="en-CEV-7189"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>David and the others went on down the road. Shimei went along the hillside by the road, cursing and throwing rocks and dirt at them. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-16-14" id="en-CEV-7190"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>When David and those with him came to the Jordan River, they were tired out. But after they rested, they<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-7190c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-7190c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-7190c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> felt much better.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 2Sam-16-15" id="en-CEV-7191">Hushai Meets Absalom</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-16-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>By this time, Absalom, Ahithophel, and the others had reached Jerusalem. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-16-16" id="en-CEV-7192"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>David's friend Hushai came to Absalom and said, “Long live the king! Long live the king!”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-16-17" id="en-CEV-7193"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>But Absalom asked Hushai, “Is this how you show loyalty to your friend David? Why didn't you go with him?”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-16-18" id="en-CEV-7194"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Hushai answered, “The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> and the people of Israel have chosen you to be king. I can't leave. I have to stay and serve the one they've chosen. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-16-19" id="en-CEV-7195"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Besides, it seems right for me to serve you, just as I served your father.”</span></p> <h3><span class="text 2Sam-16-20" id="en-CEV-7196">Ahithophel's Advice</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-16-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Absalom turned to Ahithophel and said, “Give us your advice! What should we do?”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-16-21" id="en-CEV-7197"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Ahithophel answered, “Some of your father's wives<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-7197d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-7197d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-7197d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> were left here to take care of the palace. You should have sex with them. Then everyone will find out that you have publicly disgraced your father. This will make you and your followers even more powerful.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-16-22" id="en-CEV-7198"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup> Absalom had a tent set up on the flat roof of the palace, and everyone watched as he went into the tent with his father's wives.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-16-23" id="en-CEV-7199"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>Ahithophel gave such good advice in those days that both Absalom and David thought it came straight from God.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
