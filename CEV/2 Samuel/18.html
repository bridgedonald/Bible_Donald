<h3><span class="text 2Sam-18-1" id="en-CEV-7228">David Gets Ready for Battle</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text 2Sam-18-1"><span class="chapternum">18 </span>David divided his soldiers into groups of 100 and groups of 1,000. Then he chose officers to be in command of each group. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-18-2" id="en-CEV-7229"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>He sent out one third of his army under the command of Joab, another third under the command of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, and the rest under the command of Ittai from Gath. He told the soldiers, “I'm going into battle with you.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-18-3" id="en-CEV-7230"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>But the soldiers said, “No, don't go into battle with us! It won't matter to our enemies if they make us all run away, or even if they kill half of us. But you are worth 10,000 of us. It would be better for you to stay in town and send help if we need it.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-18-4-2Sam-18-6" id="en-CEV-7231"><sup class="versenum">4-6 </sup>David said, “All right, if you think I should.”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-18-4-2Sam-18-6">Then in a voice loud enough for everyone to hear, he said, “Joab! Abishai! Ittai! For my sake, be sure that Absalom comes back unharmed.”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-18-4-2Sam-18-6">David stood beside the town gate as his army marched past in groups of 100 and in groups of 1,000.</span></p><h3><span class="text 2Sam-18-4-2Sam-18-6">Joab Kills Absalom</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-18-4-2Sam-18-6">The war with Israel took place in Ephraim Forest. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-18-7-2Sam-18-8" id="en-CEV-7232"><sup class="versenum">7-8 </sup>Battles were being fought all over the forest, and David's soldiers were winning. Twenty thousand soldiers were killed<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-7232a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-7232a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-7232a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> that day, and more of them died from the dangers of the forest than from the fighting itself.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-18-9" id="en-CEV-7233"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Absalom was riding his mule under a huge tree when his head<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-7233b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-7233b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-7233b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> caught in the branches. The mule ran off and left Absalom hanging in midair. Some of David's soldiers happened by, </span> <span class="text 2Sam-18-10" id="en-CEV-7234"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>and one of them went and told Joab, “I saw Absalom hanging in a tree!”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-18-11" id="en-CEV-7235"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Joab said, “You saw Absalom? Why didn't you kill him? I would have given you ten pieces of silver and a special belt.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-18-12" id="en-CEV-7236"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>The man answered, “Even if you paid me 1,000 pieces of silver here and now, I still wouldn't touch the king's son. We all heard King David tell you and Abishai and Ittai not to harm Absalom. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-18-13" id="en-CEV-7237"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>He always finds out what's going on. I would have been risking my life to kill Absalom, because you would have let me take the blame.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-18-14" id="en-CEV-7238"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Joab said, “I'm not going to waste any more time on you!”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-18-14">Absalom was still alive, so Joab took three spears and stuck them through Absalom's chest. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-18-15" id="en-CEV-7239"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Ten of Joab's bodyguards came over and finished him off. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-18-16" id="en-CEV-7240"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Then Joab blew a trumpet to signal his troops to stop chasing Israel's soldiers. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-18-17" id="en-CEV-7241"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>They threw Absalom's body into a deep pit in the forest and put a big pile of rocks over it.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-18-17">Meanwhile, the people of Israel had all run back to their own homes.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-18-18" id="en-CEV-7242"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>When Absalom was alive, he had set up a stone monument for himself in King's Valley.
