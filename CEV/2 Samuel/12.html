<p> <span class="text 2Sam-12-1" id="en-CEV-7043"><span class="chapternum mid-paragraph">12 </span><sup class="versenum mid-paragraph">1 </sup> and he sent Nathan the prophet to tell this story to David:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 2Sam-12-1">A rich man and a poor man lived in the same town. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-12-2" id="en-CEV-7044"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>The rich man owned a lot of sheep and cattle, </span> <span class="text 2Sam-12-3" id="en-CEV-7045"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>but the poor man had only one little lamb that he had bought and raised. The lamb became a pet for him and his children. He even let it eat from his plate and drink from his cup and sleep on his lap. The lamb was like one of his own children.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text 2Sam-12-4" id="en-CEV-7046"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>One day someone came to visit the rich man, but the rich man didn't want to kill any of his own sheep or cattle and serve it to the visitor. So he stole the poor man's lamb and served it instead.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-12-5" id="en-CEV-7047"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>David was furious with the rich man and said to Nathan, “I swear by the living <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> that the man who did this deserves to die! </span> <span class="text 2Sam-12-6" id="en-CEV-7048"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>And because he didn't have pity on the poor man, he will have to pay four times what the lamb was worth.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-12-7" id="en-CEV-7049"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Then Nathan told David:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 2Sam-12-7">You are that rich man! Now listen to what the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God of Israel says to you: “I chose you to be the king of Israel. I kept you safe from Saul </span> <span class="text 2Sam-12-8" id="en-CEV-7050"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>and even gave you his house and his wives. I let you rule Israel and Judah, and if that had not been enough, I would have given you much more. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-12-9" id="en-CEV-7051"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Why did you disobey me and do such a horrible thing? You murdered Uriah the Hittite by letting the Ammonites kill him, so you could take his wife.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text 2Sam-12-10" id="en-CEV-7052"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>“Because you wouldn't obey me and took Uriah's wife for yourself, your family will never live in peace. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-12-11" id="en-CEV-7053"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup> Someone from your own family will cause you a lot of trouble, and I will take your wives and give them to another man before your very eyes. He will go to bed with them while everyone looks on. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-12-12" id="en-CEV-7054"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>What you did was in secret, but I will do this in the open for everyone in Israel to see.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-12-13-2Sam-12-14" id="en-CEV-7055"><sup class="versenum">13-14 </sup>David said, “I have disobeyed the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>.”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-12-13-2Sam-12-14">“Yes, you have!” Nathan answered. “You showed you didn't care what the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> wanted.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-7055a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-7055a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-7055a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> He has forgiven you, and you won't die. But your newborn son will.” </span> <span class="text 2Sam-12-15" id="en-CEV-7056"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Then Nathan went back home.</span></p><h3><span class="text 2Sam-12-15">David's Young Son Dies</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-12-15">The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> made David's young son very sick.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-12-16" id="en-CEV-7057"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>So David went without eating to show his sorrow, and he begged God to make the boy well. David would not sleep on his bed, but spent each night lying on the floor. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-12-17" id="en-CEV-7058"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>His officials stood beside him and tried to talk him into getting up. But he would not get up or eat with them.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-12-18" id="en-CEV-7059"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>After the child had been sick for seven days, he died, but the officials were afraid to tell David. They said to each other, “Even when the boy was alive, David wouldn't listen to us. How can we tell him his son is dead? He might do something terrible!”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-12-19" id="en-CEV-7060"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>David noticed his servants whispering, and he knew the boy was dead. “Did my son die?” he asked his servants.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-12-19">“Yes, he did,” they answered.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-12-20" id="en-CEV-7061"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>David got up off the floor; he took a bath, combed his hair, and dressed. He went into the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s tent and worshiped, then he went back home. David asked for something to eat, and when his servants brought him some food, he ate it.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-12-21" id="en-CEV-7062"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>His officials said, “What are you doing? You went without eating and cried for your son while he was alive! But now that he's dead, you're up and eating.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-12-22" id="en-CEV-7063"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>David answered:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 2Sam-12-22">While he was still alive, I went without food and cried because there was still hope. I said to myself, “Who knows? Maybe the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will have pity on me and let the child live.” </span> <span class="text 2Sam-12-23" id="en-CEV-7064"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>But now that he's dead, why should I go without eating? I can't bring him back! Someday I will join him in death, but he can't return to me.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 2Sam-12-24" id="en-CEV-7065">Solomon Is Born</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-12-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>David comforted his wife Bathsheba and slept with her.
