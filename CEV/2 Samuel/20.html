<h3><span class="text 2Sam-20-1" id="en-CEV-7299">Sheba Rebels against David</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text 2Sam-20-1"><span class="chapternum">20 </span> A troublemaker from the tribe of Benjamin was there. His name was Sheba the son of Bichri, and he blew a trumpet to get everyone's attention. Then he said, “People of Israel, David the son of Jesse doesn't belong to us! Let's go home.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-20-2" id="en-CEV-7300"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>So they stopped following David and went off with Sheba. But the people of Judah stayed close to David all the way from the Jordan to Jerusalem.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 2Sam-20-3" id="en-CEV-7301">David's Ten Wives</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-20-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup> David had left ten of his wives in Jerusalem to take care of his palace. But when he came back, he had them taken to another house, and he placed soldiers there to guard them. He gave them whatever they needed, but he never slept with any of them again.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-7301a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-7301a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-7301a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> They had to live there for the rest of their lives as if they were widows.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 2Sam-20-4" id="en-CEV-7302">The Army Goes after Sheba</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-20-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>David said to Amasa, “Three days from now I want you and all of Judah's army to be here!”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-20-5" id="en-CEV-7303"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Amasa started bringing the army together, but it was taking him more than three days. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-20-6" id="en-CEV-7304"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>So David said to Abishai, “Sheba will hurt us more than Absalom ever did. Take my best soldiers and go after him. We don't want him to take over any walled cities and get away from us.”<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-7304b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-7304b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-7304b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup></span></p> <h3><span class="text 2Sam-20-7" id="en-CEV-7305">Joab Kills Amasa</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-20-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Abishai left Jerusalem to try and capture Sheba.

Joab had a dagger strapped around his waist over his military uniform, but it fell out as he started toward Amasa.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-20-9" id="en-CEV-7307"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Joab said, “Amasa, my cousin, how are you?” Then Joab took hold of Amasa's beard with his right hand, so that he could greet him with a kiss. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-20-10" id="en-CEV-7308"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Amasa did not see the dagger in Joab's other hand. Joab stuck it in Amasa's stomach, and his insides spilled out on the ground. Joab only struck him once, but Amasa was dying.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-20-10">Joab and his brother Abishai went off to chase Sheba. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-20-11" id="en-CEV-7309"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>One of Joab's soldiers stood by Amasa and shouted, “If any of you are for Joab and David, then follow Joab!”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-20-12" id="en-CEV-7310"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Amasa was still rolling in his own blood in the middle of the road. The soldier who had shouted noticed that everyone who passed by would stop, so he dragged Amasa off the road and covered him with a blanket. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-20-13" id="en-CEV-7311"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>After this, no one else stopped. They all walked straight past him on their way to help Joab capture Sheba.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 2Sam-20-14" id="en-CEV-7312">Sheba Hides Out in the Town of Abel</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-20-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Sheba had gone through all of the tribes of Israel when he came to the town of Abel Beth-Maacah.
