<p class="chapter-2"><span class="text 2Sam-19-1" id="en-CEV-7258"><span class="chapternum">19 </span>Someone told Joab, “The king is crying because Absalom is dead.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-19-2" id="en-CEV-7259"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>David's army found out he was crying because his son had died, and their day of victory suddenly turned into a day of sadness. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-19-3" id="en-CEV-7260"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>The troops were sneaking into Mahanaim, just as if they had run away from a battle and were ashamed.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-19-4" id="en-CEV-7261"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>David covered his face with his hands and kept on crying loudly, “My son, Absalom! Absalom, my son, my son!”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-19-5" id="en-CEV-7262"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Joab went to the house where David was staying and told him:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 2Sam-19-5">You've made your soldiers ashamed! Not only did they save your life, they saved your sons and daughters and wives as well. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-19-6" id="en-CEV-7263"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>You're more loyal to your enemies than to your friends. What you've done today has shown your officers and soldiers that they don't mean a thing to you. You would be happy if Absalom was still alive, even if the rest of us were dead.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text 2Sam-19-7" id="en-CEV-7264"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Now get up! Go out there and thank them for what they did. If you don't, I swear by the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> that you won't even have one man left on your side tomorrow morning. You may have had a lot of troubles in the past, but this will be the worst thing that has ever happened to you!</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-19-8" id="en-CEV-7265"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>David got up and went to the town gate and sat down. When the people heard that he was sitting there, they came to see him.</span></p><h3><span class="text 2Sam-19-8">Israel and Judah Want David Back</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-19-8">After Israel's soldiers had all returned home, </span> <span class="text 2Sam-19-9-2Sam-19-10" id="en-CEV-7266"><sup class="versenum">9-10 </sup>everyone in Israel started arguing. They were saying to each other, “King David rescued us from the Philistines and from our other enemies. But then we chose Absalom to be our new leader, and David had to leave the country to get away. Absalom died in battle, so why hasn't something been done to bring David back?”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-19-11" id="en-CEV-7267"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>When David found out what they were saying, he sent a message to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. It said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 2Sam-19-11">Say to the leaders of Judah, “Why are you the last tribe to think about bringing King David back home? </span> <span class="text 2Sam-19-12" id="en-CEV-7268"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>He is your brother, your own relative! Why haven't you done anything to bring him back?”</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text 2Sam-19-13" id="en-CEV-7269"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>And tell Amasa, “You're my nephew, and with God as a witness, I swear I'll make you commander of my army instead of Joab.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-19-14" id="en-CEV-7270"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Soon the tribe of Judah again became followers of David, and they sent him this message: “Come back, and bring your soldiers with you.”</span></p> <h3><span class="text 2Sam-19-15" id="en-CEV-7271">David Starts Back for Jerusalem</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-19-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>David started back and had gone as far as the Jordan River when he met the people of Judah.

That's why I wanted to be the first one from the northern tribes to meet you.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-19-21" id="en-CEV-7277"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>But Abishai shouted, “You should be killed for cursing the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s chosen king!”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-19-22" id="en-CEV-7278"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>David said, “Abishai, what will I ever do with you and your brother Joab? Is it your job to tell me who has done wrong? I've been made king of all Israel today, and no one will be put to death!” </span> <span class="text 2Sam-19-23" id="en-CEV-7279"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>Then David promised Shimei that he would not be killed.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 2Sam-19-24-2Sam-19-25" id="en-CEV-7280">Mephibosheth Meets with David</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-19-24-2Sam-19-25"><sup class="versenum">24-25 </sup> Mephibosheth, the grandson of Saul, also came to meet David. He had missed David so much that he had not taken a bath or trimmed his beard or washed his clothes the whole time David was gone. David asked him, “Why didn't you go with me?”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-19-26" id="en-CEV-7281"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>He answered, “Your Majesty, you know I can't walk.
