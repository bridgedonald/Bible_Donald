Let's hear what he has to say.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-17-6" id="en-CEV-7205"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Hushai came in, and Absalom told him what Ahithophel had planned. Then Absalom said, “Should we do what he says? And if we shouldn't, can you come up with anything better?”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-17-7" id="en-CEV-7206"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Hushai said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 2Sam-17-7">This time Ahithophel's advice isn't so good. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-17-8" id="en-CEV-7207"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>You know that your father and his followers are real warriors. Now they are as fierce as a mother bear whose cubs have just been killed. Besides, your father has a lot of experience in fighting wars, and he won't be spending the night with the others. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-17-9" id="en-CEV-7208"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>He has probably already found a hiding place in a cave or somewhere else.</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 2Sam-17-9">As soon as anyone hears that some of your soldiers have been killed, everyone will think your whole army has been destroyed. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-17-10" id="en-CEV-7209"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Then even those who are as brave as a lion will lose their courage. All Israel knows what a great warrior your father is and what brave soldiers he has.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text 2Sam-17-11" id="en-CEV-7210"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>My advice is to gather all the fighting men of Israel from the town of Dan in the north down to the town of Beersheba in the south. You will have more soldiers than there are grains of sand on the seashore. Absalom, you should lead them yourself, </span> <span class="text 2Sam-17-12" id="en-CEV-7211"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>and we will all go to fight David wherever he is. We will fall on him just as dew falls and covers the ground. He and all his soldiers will die! </span> <span class="text 2Sam-17-13" id="en-CEV-7212"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>If they go into a walled town, we will put ropes around that town and drag it into the river. We won't leave even one small piece of a stone.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-17-14" id="en-CEV-7213"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Absalom and the others liked Hushai's plan better than Ahithophel's plan. This was because the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had decided to keep Ahithophel's plan from working and to cause trouble for Absalom.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 2Sam-17-15" id="en-CEV-7214">Jonathan and Ahimaaz Tell David the News</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-17-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>At once, Hushai went to Zadok and Abiathar.

He also told them about the advice he had given. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-17-16" id="en-CEV-7215"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Then he said, “Hurry!
