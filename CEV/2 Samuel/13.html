<h3><span class="text 2Sam-13-1" id="en-CEV-7073">Amnon Disgraces Tamar</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text 2Sam-13-1"><span class="chapternum">13 </span>David had a beautiful daughter named Tamar, who was the sister of Absalom. She was also the half sister of Amnon,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-7073a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-7073a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-7073a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> who fell in love with her. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-13-2" id="en-CEV-7074"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>But Tamar was a virgin, and Amnon could not think of a way to be alone with her. He was so upset about it that he made himself sick.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-13-3" id="en-CEV-7075"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Amnon had a friend named Jonadab, who was the son of David's brother Shimeah. Jonadab always knew how to get what he wanted, </span> <span class="text 2Sam-13-4" id="en-CEV-7076"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>and he said to Amnon, “What's the matter? You're the king's son! You shouldn't have to go around feeling sorry for yourself every morning.”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-13-4">Amnon said, “I'm in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-13-5" id="en-CEV-7077"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Jonadab told him, “Lie down on your bed and pretend to be sick. When your father comes to see you, ask him to send Tamar, so you can watch her cook something for you. Then she can serve you the food.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-13-6" id="en-CEV-7078"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>So Amnon went to bed and pretended to be sick. When the king came to see him, Amnon said, “Please, ask Tamar to come over. She can make some special bread<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-7078b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-7078b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-7078b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> while I watch, and then she can serve it to me.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-13-7" id="en-CEV-7079"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>David told Tamar, “Go over to Amnon's house and fix him some food.” </span> <span class="text 2Sam-13-8" id="en-CEV-7080"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>When she got there, he was lying in bed. She mixed the dough, made the loaves, and baked them while he watched. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-13-9" id="en-CEV-7081"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Then she took the bread out of the pan and put it on his plate, but he refused to eat it.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-13-9">Amnon said, “Send the servants out of the house.” After they had gone, </span> <span class="text 2Sam-13-10" id="en-CEV-7082"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>he said to Tamar, “Serve the food in my bedroom.”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-13-10">Tamar picked up the bread that she had made and brought it into Amnon's bedroom. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-13-11" id="en-CEV-7083"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>But as she was taking it over to him, he grabbed her and said, “Come to bed with me!”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-13-12" id="en-CEV-7084"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>She answered, “No! Please don't force me! This sort of thing isn't done in Israel. It's disgusting! </span> <span class="text 2Sam-13-13" id="en-CEV-7085"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Think of me. I'll be disgraced forever! And think of yourself. Everyone in Israel will say you're nothing but trash! Just ask the king, and he will let you marry me.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-13-14" id="en-CEV-7086"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>But Amnon would not listen to what she said. He was stronger than she was, so he overpowered her and raped her. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-13-15" id="en-CEV-7087"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Then Amnon hated her even more than he had loved her before. So he told her, “Get up and get out!”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-13-16" id="en-CEV-7088"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>She said, “Don't send me away! That would be worse than what you have already done.”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-13-16">But Amnon would not listen. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-13-17" id="en-CEV-7089"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>He called in his servant and said, “Throw this woman out and lock the door!”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-13-18" id="en-CEV-7090"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>The servant made her leave, and he locked the door behind her.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-13-18">The king's unmarried daughters used to wear long robes with sleeves.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-7090c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-7090c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-7090c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text 2Sam-13-19" id="en-CEV-7091"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Tamar tore the robe she was wearing and put ashes on her head. Then she covered her face with her hands and cried loudly as she walked away.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 2Sam-13-20" id="en-CEV-7092">Absalom Kills Amnon</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-13-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Tamar's brother Absalom said to her, “How could Amnon have done such a terrible thing to you! But since he's your brother, don't tell anyone what happened. Just try not to think about it.”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-13-20">Tamar soon moved into Absalom's house, but she was always sad and lonely. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-13-21" id="en-CEV-7093"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>When David heard what had happened to Tamar, he was very angry. But Amnon was his oldest son and also his favorite, and David would not do anything to make Amnon unhappy.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-7093d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-7093d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-7093d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-13-22" id="en-CEV-7094"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Absalom treated Amnon as though nothing had happened, but he hated Amnon for what he had done to his sister Tamar.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-13-23" id="en-CEV-7095"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>Two years later, Absalom's servants were cutting wool from his sheep in Baal-Hazor near the town of Ephraim, and Absalom invited all of the king's sons to be there.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-7095e" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-7095e" title="See footnote e"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-7095e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text 2Sam-13-24" id="en-CEV-7096"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>Then he went to David and said, “My servants are cutting the wool from my sheep. Please come and join us!”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-13-25" id="en-CEV-7097"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>David answered, “No, my son, we won't go. It would be too expensive for you.” Absalom tried to get him to change his mind, but David did not want to go. He only said that he hoped they would have a good time.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-13-26" id="en-CEV-7098"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>Absalom said, “If you won't go, at least let my brother Amnon come with us.”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-13-26">David asked, “Why should he go with you?” </span> <span class="text 2Sam-13-27" id="en-CEV-7099"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>But Absalom kept on insisting, and finally David let Amnon and all his other sons go with Absalom.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-13-27">Absalom prepared a banquet fit for a king.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-7099f" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-7099f" title="See footnote f"&gt;f&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-7099f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text 2Sam-13-28" id="en-CEV-7100"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>But he told his servants, “Keep an eye on Amnon. When he gets a little drunk from the wine and is feeling relaxed, I'll give the signal. Then kill him! I've commanded you to do it, so don't be afraid. Be strong and brave.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-13-29" id="en-CEV-7101"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>Absalom's servants killed Amnon, just as Absalom had told them. The rest of the king's sons quickly rode away on their mules to escape from Absalom.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-13-30" id="en-CEV-7102"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>While they were on their way to Jerusalem, someone told David, “Absalom has killed all of your sons! Not even one is left.” </span> <span class="text 2Sam-13-31" id="en-CEV-7103"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>David got up, and in his sorrow he tore his clothes and lay down on the ground.
