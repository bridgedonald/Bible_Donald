Joab told her, “Put on funeral clothes and don't use any makeup. Go to the king and pretend you have spent a long time mourning the death of a loved one.” Then he told her what to say.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-14-4" id="en-CEV-7113"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>The woman from Tekoa went to David. She bowed very low and said, “Your Majesty, please help me!”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-14-5" id="en-CEV-7114"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>David asked, “What's the matter?”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-14-5">She replied:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 2Sam-14-5">My husband is dead, and I'm a widow. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-14-6" id="en-CEV-7115"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>I had two sons, but they got into a fight out in a field where there was no one to pull them apart, and one of them killed the other. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-14-7" id="en-CEV-7116"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Now all of my relatives have come to me and said, “Hand over your son! We're going to put him to death for killing his brother.” But what they really want is to get rid of him, so they can take over our land.</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 2Sam-14-7">Please don't let them put out my only flame of hope! There won't be anyone left on this earth to carry on my husband's name.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-14-8" id="en-CEV-7117"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>“Go on home,” David told her. “I'll take care of this matter for you.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-14-9" id="en-CEV-7118"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>The woman said, “I hope your decision doesn't cause any problems for you.

Your own son had to leave the country. And when you judged in my favor, it was the same as admitting that you should have let him come back. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-14-14" id="en-CEV-7123"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>We each must die and disappear like water poured out on the ground.

I decided to come to you, because I thought you could help. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-14-16" id="en-CEV-7125"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>In fact, I knew that you would listen and save my son and me from those who want to take the land that God gave us.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-7125c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-7125c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-7125c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup></span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text 2Sam-14-17" id="en-CEV-7126"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup> I can rest easy now that you have given your decision. You know the difference between right and wrong just like an angel of God, and I pray that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> your God will be with you.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-14-18" id="en-CEV-7127"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Then David said to the woman, “Now I'm going to ask you a question, and don't try to hide the truth!”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-14-18">The woman replied, “Please go ahead, Your Majesty.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-14-19" id="en-CEV-7128"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>David asked, “Did Joab put you up to this?”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-14-19">The woman answered, “Your Majesty, I swear by your life that no one can hide the truth from you. Yes, Joab did tell me what to say, </span> <span class="text 2Sam-14-20" id="en-CEV-7129"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>but only to show you the other side of this problem. You must be as wise as the angel of God to know everything that goes on in this country.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-14-21" id="en-CEV-7130"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>David turned to Joab and said, “It seems that I have already given my decision. Go and bring Absalom back.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-14-22" id="en-CEV-7131"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Joab bowed very low and said, “Your Majesty, I thank you for giving your permission. It shows that you approve of me.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-14-23" id="en-CEV-7132"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>Joab went to Geshur to get Absalom. But when they came back to Jerusalem, </span> <span class="text 2Sam-14-24" id="en-CEV-7133"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>David told Joab, “I don't want to see my son Absalom. Tell him to stay away from me.” So Absalom went to his own house without seeing his father.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 2Sam-14-25" id="en-CEV-7134">Absalom Was Handsome</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-14-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>No one in all Israel was as handsome and well-built as Absalom. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-14-26" id="en-CEV-7135"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>His hair grew so thick and heavy that when he got it cut once a year, it weighed over two kilograms.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-14-27" id="en-CEV-7136"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>Absalom had three sons. He also had a daughter named Tamar, who grew up to be very beautiful.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 2Sam-14-28" id="en-CEV-7137">Absalom Finally Sees David</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-14-28"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>Absalom lived in Jerusalem for two years without seeing his father. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-14-29" id="en-CEV-7138"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>He wanted Joab to talk to David for him. So one day he sent a message asking Joab to come over, but Joab refused. Absalom sent another message, but Joab still refused. </span> <span class="text 2Sam-14-30" id="en-CEV-7139"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>Finally, Absalom told his servants, “Joab's barley field is right next to mine. Go set it on fire!” And they did.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-14-31" id="en-CEV-7140"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>Joab went to Absalom's house and demanded, “Why did your servants set my field on fire?”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-14-32" id="en-CEV-7141"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>Absalom answered, “You didn't pay any attention when I sent for you. I want you to ask my father why he told me to come back from Geshur. I was better off there. I want to see my father now! If I'm guilty, let him kill me.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Sam-14-33" id="en-CEV-7142"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>Joab went to David and told him what Absalom had said. David sent for Absalom, and Absalom came. He bowed very low, and David leaned over and kissed him.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
