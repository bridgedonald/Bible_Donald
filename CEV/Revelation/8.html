<h3><span class="text Rev-8-1" id="en-CEV-28705">The Seventh Seal Is Opened</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Rev-8-1"><span class="chapternum">8 </span>When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. </span> <span class="text Rev-8-2" id="en-CEV-28706"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>I noticed that the seven angels who stood before God were each given a trumpet.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-8-3" id="en-CEV-28707"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup> Another angel, who had a gold container for incense,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28707a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28707a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28707a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> came and stood at the altar. This one was given a lot of incense to offer with the prayers of God's people on the gold altar in front of the throne. </span> <span class="text Rev-8-4" id="en-CEV-28708"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Then the smoke of the incense, together with the prayers of God's people, went up to God from the hand of the angel.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-8-5" id="en-CEV-28709"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup> After this, the angel filled the incense container with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth. Thunder roared, lightning flashed, and the earth shook.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Rev-8-6" id="en-CEV-28710">The Trumpets</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-8-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup> The seven angels now got ready to blow their trumpets.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-8-7" id="en-CEV-28711"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup> When the first angel blew his trumpet, hail and fire mixed with blood were thrown down on the earth. A third of the earth, a third of the trees, and a third of all green plants were burned.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-8-8" id="en-CEV-28712"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>When the second angel blew his trumpet, something like a great fiery mountain was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea turned to blood, </span> <span class="text Rev-8-9" id="en-CEV-28713"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-8-10" id="en-CEV-28714"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup> When the third angel blew his trumpet, a great star fell from heaven. It was burning like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on a third of the springs of water. </span> <span class="text Rev-8-11" id="en-CEV-28715"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup> The name of the star was Bitter, and a third of the water turned bitter. Many people died because the water was so bitter.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-8-12" id="en-CEV-28716"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup> When the fourth angel blew his trumpet, a third of the sun, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars were struck. They each lost a third of their light. So during a third of the day there was no light, and a third of the night was also without light.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-8-13" id="en-CEV-28717"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Then I looked and saw a lone eagle flying across the sky. It was shouting, “Trouble, trouble, trouble to everyone who lives on earth! The other three angels are now going to blow their trumpets.”</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
