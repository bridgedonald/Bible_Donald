<h3><span class="text Rev-12-1" id="en-CEV-28769">The Woman and the Dragon</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Rev-12-1"><span class="chapternum">12 </span>Something important appeared in the sky. It was a woman whose clothes were the sun. The moon was under her feet, and a crown made of twelve stars was on her head. </span> <span class="text Rev-12-2" id="en-CEV-28770"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>She was about to give birth, and she was crying because of the great pain.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-12-3" id="en-CEV-28771"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup> Something else appeared in the sky. It was a huge red dragon with seven heads and ten horns, and a crown on each of its seven heads. </span> <span class="text Rev-12-4" id="en-CEV-28772"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup> With its tail, it dragged a third of the stars from the sky and threw them down to the earth. Then the dragon turned toward the woman, because it wanted to eat her child as soon as it was born.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-12-5" id="en-CEV-28773"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup> The woman gave birth to a son, who would rule all nations with an iron rod. The boy was snatched away. He was taken to God and placed on his throne. </span> <span class="text Rev-12-6" id="en-CEV-28774"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>The woman ran into the desert to a place that God had prepared for her. There she would be taken care of for 1,260 days.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Rev-12-7" id="en-CEV-28775">Michael Fights the Dragon</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-12-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup> A war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels were fighting against the dragon and its angels. </span> <span class="text Rev-12-8" id="en-CEV-28776"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>But the dragon lost the battle. It and its angels were forced out of their places in heaven </span> <span class="text Rev-12-9" id="en-CEV-28777"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup> and were thrown down to the earth. Yes, that old snake and his angels were thrown out of heaven! That snake, who fools everyone on earth, is known as the devil and Satan. </span> <span class="text Rev-12-10" id="en-CEV-28778"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup> Then I heard a voice from heaven shout,</span></p><div class="poetry"><p class="line"><span class="text Rev-12-10">“Our God has shown</span><br/><span class="text Rev-12-10">his saving power,</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Rev-12-10">and his kingdom has come!</span></span><br/><span class="text Rev-12-10">God's own Chosen One</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Rev-12-10">has shown his authority.</span></span><br/><span class="text Rev-12-10">Satan accused our people</span><br/><span class="text Rev-12-10">in the presence of God</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Rev-12-10">day and night.</span></span><br/><span class="text Rev-12-10">Now he has been thrown out!</span></p></div> <div class="poetry top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Rev-12-11" id="en-CEV-28779"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>“Our people defeated Satan</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Rev-12-11">because of the blood<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28779a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28779a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28779a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></span></span><br/><span class="text Rev-12-11">of the Lamb</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Rev-12-11">and the message of God.</span></span><br/><span class="text Rev-12-11">They were willing</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Rev-12-11">to give up their lives.</span></span></p></div> <div class="poetry top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Rev-12-12" id="en-CEV-28780"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>“The heavens should rejoice,</span><br/><span class="text Rev-12-12">together with everyone</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Rev-12-12">who lives there.</span></span><br/><span class="text Rev-12-12">But pity the earth</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Rev-12-12">and the sea,</span></span><br/><span class="text Rev-12-12">because the devil</span><br/><span class="text Rev-12-12">was thrown down</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Rev-12-12">to the earth.</span></span><br/><span class="text Rev-12-12">He knows his time is short,</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Rev-12-12">and he is very angry.”</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1"><span class="text Rev-12-13" id="en-CEV-28781"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>When the dragon realized it had been thrown down to the earth, it tried to make trouble for the woman who had given birth to a son. </span> <span class="text Rev-12-14" id="en-CEV-28782"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup> But the woman was given two wings like those of a huge eagle, so she could fly into the desert.
