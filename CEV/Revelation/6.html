<h3><span class="text Rev-6-1" id="en-CEV-28672">Opening the Seven Seals</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Rev-6-1"><span class="chapternum">6 </span>At the same time I saw the Lamb open the first of the seven seals, I heard one of the four living creatures shout with a voice like thunder. It said, “Come out!” </span> <span class="text Rev-6-2" id="en-CEV-28673"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup> Then I saw a white horse. Its rider carried a bow and was given a crown. He had already won some victories, and he went out to win more.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-6-3" id="en-CEV-28674"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>When the Lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, “Come out!” </span> <span class="text Rev-6-4" id="en-CEV-28675"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup> Then another horse came out. It was fiery red. And its rider was given the power to take away all peace from the earth, so people would slaughter one another. He was also given a big sword.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-6-5" id="en-CEV-28676"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup> When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, “Come out!” Then I saw a black horse, and its rider had a balance scale in one hand. </span> <span class="text Rev-6-6" id="en-CEV-28677"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>I heard what sounded like a voice from somewhere among the four living creatures. It said, “A liter of wheat will cost you a whole day's wages! Three liters of barley will cost you a day's wages too. But don't ruin the olive oil or the wine.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-6-7" id="en-CEV-28678"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Come out!” </span> <span class="text Rev-6-8" id="en-CEV-28679"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup> Then I saw a pale green horse. Its rider was named Death, and Death's Kingdom followed close behind. They were given power over one fourth of the earth, and they could kill its people with swords, famines, diseases, and wild animals.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-6-9" id="en-CEV-28680"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>When the Lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of everyone who had been killed for speaking God's message and telling about their faith. </span> <span class="text Rev-6-10" id="en-CEV-28681"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>They shouted, “Master, you are holy and faithful! How long will it be before you judge and punish the people of this earth who killed us?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-6-11" id="en-CEV-28682"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup> Then each of those who had been killed was given a white robe and told to rest for a little while. They had to wait until the complete number of the Lord's other servants and followers would be killed.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-6-12" id="en-CEV-28683"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup> When I saw the Lamb open the sixth seal, I looked and saw a great earthquake. The sun turned as dark as sackcloth,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28683a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28683a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28683a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> and the moon became red as blood. </span> <span class="text Rev-6-13" id="en-CEV-28684"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup> The stars in the sky fell to earth, just like figs shaken loose by a windstorm. </span> <span class="text Rev-6-14" id="en-CEV-28685"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup> Then the sky was rolled up like a scroll,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28685b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28685b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28685b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> and all mountains and islands were moved from their places.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-6-15" id="en-CEV-28686"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup> The kings of the earth, its famous people, and its military leaders hid in caves or behind rocks on the mountains. They hid there together with the rich and the powerful and with all the slaves and free people. </span> <span class="text Rev-6-16" id="en-CEV-28687"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup> Then they shouted to the mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us! Hide us from the one who sits on the throne and from the anger of the Lamb. </span> <span class="text Rev-6-17" id="en-CEV-28688"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup> That terrible day has come! God and the Lamb will show their anger, and who can face it?”</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
