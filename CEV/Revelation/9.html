<p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Rev-9-1" id="en-CEV-28718"><span class="chapternum">9 </span>When the fifth angel blew his trumpet, I saw a star<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28718a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28718a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28718a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> fall from the sky to earth. It was given the key to the tunnel that leads down to the deep pit. </span> <span class="text Rev-9-2" id="en-CEV-28719"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup> As it opened the tunnel, smoke poured out like the smoke of a great furnace. The sun and the air turned dark because of the smoke. </span> <span class="text Rev-9-3" id="en-CEV-28720"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup> Locusts<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28720b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28720b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28720b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> came out of the smoke and covered the earth. They were given the same power that scorpions have.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-9-4" id="en-CEV-28721"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup> The locusts were told not to harm the grass on the earth or any plant or any tree. They were to punish only those people who did not have God's mark on their foreheads. </span> <span class="text Rev-9-5" id="en-CEV-28722"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>The locusts were allowed to make them suffer for five months, but not to kill them. The suffering they caused was like the sting of a scorpion. </span> <span class="text Rev-9-6" id="en-CEV-28723"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup> In those days people will want to die, but they will not be able to. They will hope for death, but it will escape from them.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-9-7" id="en-CEV-28724"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup> These locusts looked like horses ready for battle. On their heads they wore something like gold crowns, and they had human faces. </span> <span class="text Rev-9-8" id="en-CEV-28725"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup> Their hair was like a woman's long hair, and their teeth were like those of a lion. </span> <span class="text Rev-9-9" id="en-CEV-28726"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup> On their chests they wore armor made of iron. Their wings roared like an army of horse-drawn chariots rushing into battle. </span> <span class="text Rev-9-10" id="en-CEV-28727"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Their tails were like a scorpion's tail with a stinger that had the power to hurt someone for five months. </span> <span class="text Rev-9-11" id="en-CEV-28728"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Their king was the angel in charge of the deep pit. In Hebrew his name was Abaddon, and in Greek it was Apollyon.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28728c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28728c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28728c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-9-12" id="en-CEV-28729"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>The first horrible thing has now happened! But wait. Two more horrible things will happen soon.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-9-13" id="en-CEV-28730"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup> Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet. I heard a voice speak from the four corners of the gold altar that stands in the presence of God. </span> <span class="text Rev-9-14" id="en-CEV-28731"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>The voice spoke to this angel and said, “Release the four angels who are tied up beside the great Euphrates River.” </span> <span class="text Rev-9-15" id="en-CEV-28732"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>The four angels had been prepared for this very hour and day and month and year. Now they were set free to kill a third of all people.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-9-16" id="en-CEV-28733"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>By listening, I could tell there were more than 200,000,000 war horses. </span> <span class="text Rev-9-17" id="en-CEV-28734"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup> In my vision their riders wore fiery-red, dark-blue, and yellow armor on their chests. The heads of the horses looked like lions, with fire and smoke and sulfur coming out of their mouths. </span> <span class="text Rev-9-18" id="en-CEV-28735"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>One third of all people were killed by the three terrible troubles caused by the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur. </span> <span class="text Rev-9-19" id="en-CEV-28736"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>The horses had powerful mouths, and their tails were like poisonous snakes that bite and hurt.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-9-20" id="en-CEV-28737"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup> The people who lived through these terrible troubles did not turn away from the idols they had made, and they did not stop worshiping demons. They kept on worshiping idols that were made of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood. Not one of these idols could see, hear, or walk. </span> <span class="text Rev-9-21" id="en-CEV-28738"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>No one stopped murdering or practicing witchcraft or being immoral or stealing.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
