<h3><span class="text Rev-10-1" id="en-CEV-28739">The Angel and the Little Scroll</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Rev-10-1"><span class="chapternum">10 </span>I saw another powerful angel come down from heaven. This one was covered with a cloud, and a rainbow was over his head. His face was like the sun, his legs were like columns of fire, </span> <span class="text Rev-10-2" id="en-CEV-28740"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>and with his hand he held a little scroll<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28740a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28740a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28740a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> that had been unrolled. He stood there with his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land. </span> <span class="text Rev-10-3" id="en-CEV-28741"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Then he shouted with a voice that sounded like a growling lion. Thunder roared seven times.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-10-4" id="en-CEV-28742"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>After the thunder stopped, I was about to write what it had said. But a voice from heaven shouted, “Keep it secret! Don't write these things.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-10-5" id="en-CEV-28743"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup> The angel I had seen standing on the sea and the land then held his right hand up toward heaven. </span> <span class="text Rev-10-6" id="en-CEV-28744"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>He made a promise in the name of God who lives forever and who created heaven, earth, the sea, and every living creature. The angel said, “You won't have to wait any longer. </span> <span class="text Rev-10-7" id="en-CEV-28745"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>God told his secret plans to his servants the prophets, and it will all happen by the time the seventh angel sounds his trumpet.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-10-8" id="en-CEV-28746"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup> Once again the voice from heaven spoke to me. It said, “Go and take the open scroll from the hand of the angel standing on the sea and the land.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-10-9" id="en-CEV-28747"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>When I went over to ask the angel for the little scroll, the angel said, “Take the scroll and eat it! Your stomach will turn sour, but the taste in your mouth will be sweet as honey.” </span> <span class="text Rev-10-10" id="en-CEV-28748"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>I took the little scroll from the hand of the angel and ate it. The taste was sweet as honey, but my stomach turned sour.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-10-11" id="en-CEV-28749"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Then some voices said, “Keep on telling what will happen to the people of many nations, races, and languages, and also to kings.”</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
