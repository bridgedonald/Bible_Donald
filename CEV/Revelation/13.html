<h3><span class="text Rev-13-1" id="en-CEV-28787">The Two Beasts</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Rev-13-1"><span class="chapternum">13 </span> I looked and saw a beast coming up from the sea. This one had ten horns and seven heads, and a crown was on each of its ten horns. On each of its heads were names that were an insult to God. </span> <span class="text Rev-13-2" id="en-CEV-28788"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup> The beast I saw had the body of a leopard, the feet of a bear, and the mouth of a lion. The dragon handed over its own power and throne and great authority to this beast. </span> <span class="text Rev-13-3" id="en-CEV-28789"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>One of its heads seemed to have been fatally wounded, but now it was well. Everyone on earth marveled at this beast, </span> <span class="text Rev-13-4" id="en-CEV-28790"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>and they worshiped the dragon who had given its authority to the beast. They also worshiped the beast and said, “No one is like this beast! No one can fight against it.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-13-5" id="en-CEV-28791"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup> The beast was allowed to brag and claim to be God, and for 42 months it was allowed to rule. </span> <span class="text Rev-13-6" id="en-CEV-28792"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>The beast cursed God, and it cursed the name of God. It even cursed the place where God lives, as well as everyone who lives in heaven with God. </span> <span class="text Rev-13-7" id="en-CEV-28793"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup> It was allowed to fight against God's people and defeat them. It was also given authority over the people of every tribe, nation, language, and race. </span> <span class="text Rev-13-8" id="en-CEV-28794"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup> The beast was worshiped by everyone whose name wasn't written before the time of creation in the book of the Lamb who was killed.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28794a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28794a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28794a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></span></p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line"><span class="text Rev-13-9" id="en-CEV-28795"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>If you have ears,</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Rev-13-9">then listen!</span></span><br/><span class="text Rev-13-10" id="en-CEV-28796"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup> If you are doomed</span><br/><span class="text Rev-13-10">to be captured,</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Rev-13-10">you will be captured.</span></span><br/><span class="text Rev-13-10">If you are doomed</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Rev-13-10">to be killed by a sword,</span></span><br/><span class="text Rev-13-10">you will be killed</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Rev-13-10">by a sword.</span></span></p></div><p class="top-1"><span class="text Rev-13-10">This means God's people must learn to endure and be faithful!</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-13-11" id="en-CEV-28797"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>I now saw another beast. This one came out of the ground. It had two horns like a lamb, but spoke like a dragon. </span> <span class="text Rev-13-12" id="en-CEV-28798"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>It worked for the beast whose fatal wound had been healed. And it used all its authority to force the earth and its people to worship that beast. </span> <span class="text Rev-13-13" id="en-CEV-28799"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>It worked mighty miracles, and while people watched, it even made fire come down from the sky.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-13-14" id="en-CEV-28800"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>This second beast fooled people on earth by working miracles for the first one. Then it talked them into making an idol in the form of the beast that did not die after being wounded by a sword. </span> <span class="text Rev-13-15" id="en-CEV-28801"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>It was allowed to put breath into the idol, so it could speak. Everyone who refused to worship the idol of the beast was put to death. </span> <span class="text Rev-13-16" id="en-CEV-28802"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup> All people were forced to put a mark on their right hand or forehead. Whether they were powerful or weak, rich or poor, free people or slaves, </span> <span class="text Rev-13-17" id="en-CEV-28803"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>they all had to have this mark, or else they could not buy or sell anything. This mark stood for the name of the beast and for the number of its name.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-13-18" id="en-CEV-28804"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>You need wisdom to understand the number of the beast! But if you are smart enough, you can figure this out. Its number is 666, and it stands for a person.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
