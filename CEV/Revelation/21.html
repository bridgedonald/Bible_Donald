<h3><span class="text Rev-21-1" id="en-CEV-28931">The New Heaven and the New Earth</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Rev-21-1"><span class="chapternum">21 </span> I saw a new heaven and a new earth. The first heaven and the first earth had disappeared, and so had the sea. </span> <span class="text Rev-21-2" id="en-CEV-28932"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup> Then I saw New Jerusalem, the holy city, coming down from God in heaven. It was like a bride dressed in her wedding gown and ready to meet her husband.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-21-3" id="en-CEV-28933"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup> I heard a loud voice shout from the throne:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Rev-21-3">God's home is now with his people. He will live with them, and they will be his own. Yes, God will make his home among his people. </span> <span class="text Rev-21-4" id="en-CEV-28934"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup> He will wipe all tears from their eyes, and there will be no more death, suffering, crying, or pain. These things of the past are gone forever.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-21-5" id="en-CEV-28935"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Then the one sitting on the throne said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Rev-21-5">I am making everything new. Write down what I have said. My words are true and can be trusted. </span> <span class="text Rev-21-6" id="en-CEV-28936"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup> Everything is finished! I am Alpha and Omega,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28936a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28936a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28936a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> the beginning and the end. I will freely give water from the life-giving fountain to everyone who is thirsty. </span> <span class="text Rev-21-7" id="en-CEV-28937"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup> All who win the victory will be given these blessings. I will be their God, and they will be my people.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Rev-21-8" id="en-CEV-28938"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>But I will tell you what will happen to cowards and to everyone who is unfaithful or dirty-minded or who murders or is sexually immoral or uses witchcraft or worships idols or tells lies. They will be thrown into that lake of fire and burning sulfur. This is the second death.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28938b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28938b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28938b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup></span></p> <h3><span class="text Rev-21-9" id="en-CEV-28939">The New Jerusalem</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-21-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>I saw one of the seven angels who had the bowls filled with the seven last terrible troubles. The angel came to me and said, “Come on! I will show you the one who will be the bride and wife of the Lamb.” </span> <span class="text Rev-21-10" id="en-CEV-28940"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup> Then with the help of the Spirit, he took me to the top of a very high mountain. There he showed me the holy city of Jerusalem coming down from God in heaven.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-21-11" id="en-CEV-28941"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>The glory of God made the city bright. It was dazzling and crystal clear like a precious jasper stone. </span> <span class="text Rev-21-12" id="en-CEV-28942"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup> The city had a high and thick wall with twelve gates, and each one of them was guarded by an angel. On each of the gates was written the name of one of the twelve tribes of Israel. </span> <span class="text Rev-21-13" id="en-CEV-28943"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Three of these gates were on the east, three were on the north, three more were on the south, and the other three were on the west. </span> <span class="text Rev-21-14" id="en-CEV-28944"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>The city was built on twelve foundation stones. On each of the stones was written the name of one of the Lamb's twelve apostles.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-21-15" id="en-CEV-28945"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup> The angel who spoke to me had a gold measuring stick to measure the city and its gates and its walls. </span> <span class="text Rev-21-16" id="en-CEV-28946"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>The city was shaped like a cube, because it was just as high as it was wide. When the angel measured the city, it was about 2,400 kilometers high and 2,400 kilometers wide. </span> <span class="text Rev-21-17" id="en-CEV-28947"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Then the angel measured the wall, and by our measurements it was about 60 meters high.</span></p> <p><span class="text Rev-21-18" id="en-CEV-28948"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup> The wall was built of jasper, and the city was made of pure gold, clear as crystal. </span> <span class="text Rev-21-19" id="en-CEV-28949"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Each of the twelve foundations was a precious stone.
