The governors and leaders of the provinces were also invited, and even the commanders of the Persian and Median armies came. </span> <span class="text Esth-1-4" id="en-CEV-10910"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>For 180 days he showed off his wealth and spent a lot of money to impress his guests with the greatness of his kingdom.</span></p> <p><span class="text Esth-1-5" id="en-CEV-10911"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>At the end of this time, King Xerxes gave another dinner and invited everyone in the city of Susa, no matter who they were. The eating and drinking lasted seven days in the beautiful palace gardens. </span> <span class="text Esth-1-6" id="en-CEV-10912"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>The area was decorated with blue and white cotton curtains tied back with purple linen cords that ran through silver rings fastened to marble columns. Couches of gold and silver rested on pavement that had all kinds of designs made from costly bright-colored stones and marble and mother-of-pearl.</span></p> <p><span class="text Esth-1-7" id="en-CEV-10913"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>The guests drank from gold cups, and each cup had a different design. The king was generous </span> <span class="text Esth-1-8" id="en-CEV-10914"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>and said to them, “Drink all you want!” Then he told his servants, “Keep their cups full.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Esth-1-9" id="en-CEV-10915"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>While the men were enjoying themselves, Queen Vashti gave the women a big dinner inside the royal palace.</span></p> <p><span class="text Esth-1-10" id="en-CEV-10916"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>By the seventh day, King Xerxes was feeling happy because of so much wine. And he asked his seven personal servants, Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carkas, </span> <span class="text Esth-1-11" id="en-CEV-10917"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>to bring Queen Vashti to him. The king wanted her to wear her crown and let his people and his officials see how beautiful she was. </span> <span class="text Esth-1-12" id="en-CEV-10918"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>The king's servants told Queen Vashti what he had said, but she refused to go to him, and this made him terribly angry.</span></p> <p><span class="text Esth-1-13-Esth-1-14" id="en-CEV-10919"><sup class="versenum">13-14 </sup>The king called in the seven highest officials of Persia and Media. They were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan. These men were very wise and understood all the laws and customs of the country, and the king always asked them what they thought about such matters.</span></p> <p><span class="text Esth-1-15" id="en-CEV-10920"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>The king said to them, “Queen Vashti refused to come to me when I sent my servants for her. What does the law say I should do about that?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Esth-1-16" id="en-CEV-10921"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Then Memucan told the king and the officials:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Esth-1-16">Your Majesty, Queen Vashti has not only embarrassed you, but she has insulted your officials and everyone else in all the provinces.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Esth-1-17" id="en-CEV-10922"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>The women in the kingdom will hear about this, and they will refuse to respect their husbands. They will say, “If Queen Vashti doesn't obey her husband, why should we?” </span> <span class="text Esth-1-18" id="en-CEV-10923"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Before this day is over, the wives of the officials of Persia and Media will find out what Queen Vashti has done, and they will refuse to obey their husbands. They won't respect their husbands, and their husbands will be angry with them.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Esth-1-19" id="en-CEV-10924"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Your Majesty, if you agree, you should write for the Medes and Persians a law that can never be changed. This law would keep Queen Vashti from ever seeing you again. Then you could let someone who respects you be queen in her place.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Esth-1-20" id="en-CEV-10925"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>When the women in your great kingdom hear about this new law, they will respect their husbands, no matter if they are rich or poor.</span></p> <p><span class="text Esth-1-21" id="en-CEV-10926"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>King Xerxes and his officials liked what Memucan had said, </span> <span class="text Esth-1-22" id="en-CEV-10927"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>and he sent letters to all of his provinces. Each letter was written in the language of the province to which it was sent, and it said that husbands should be in charge of their wives and children.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
