<h3><span class="text Esth-3-1" id="en-CEV-10950">Haman Plans To Destroy the Jews</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Esth-3-1"><span class="chapternum">3 </span>Later, King Xerxes promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha to the highest position in his kingdom. Haman was a descendant of Agag,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-10950a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-10950a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-10950a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Esth-3-2" id="en-CEV-10951"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>and the king had given orders for his officials at the royal gate to honor Haman by kneeling down to him. All of them obeyed except Mordecai. </span> <span class="text Esth-3-3" id="en-CEV-10952"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>When the other officials asked Mordecai why he disobeyed the king's command, </span> <span class="text Esth-3-4" id="en-CEV-10953"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>he said, “Because I am a Jew.” They spoke to him for several days about kneeling down, but he still refused to obey. Finally, they reported this to Haman, to find out if he would let Mordecai get away with it.</span></p> <p><span class="text Esth-3-5" id="en-CEV-10954"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Haman was furious to learn that Mordecai refused to kneel down and honor him. </span> <span class="text Esth-3-6" id="en-CEV-10955"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>And when he found out that Mordecai was a Jew, he knew that killing only Mordecai was not enough. Every Jew in the whole kingdom had to be killed.</span></p> <p><span class="text Esth-3-7" id="en-CEV-10956"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>It was now the twelfth year of the rule of King Xerxes. During Nisan,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-10956b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-10956b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-10956b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> the first month of the year, Haman said, “Find out the best time for me to do this.”<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-10956c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-10956c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-10956c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> The time chosen was Adar,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-10956d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-10956d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-10956d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> the twelfth month.</span></p> <p><span class="text Esth-3-8" id="en-CEV-10957"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup> Then Haman went to the king and said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Esth-3-8">Your Majesty, there are some people who live all over your kingdom and won't have a thing to do with anyone else. They have customs that are different from everyone else's, and they refuse to obey your laws. We would be better off to get rid of them! </span> <span class="text Esth-3-9" id="en-CEV-10958"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Why not give orders for all of them to be killed? I can promise that you will get tons of silver for your treasury.</span></p> <p><span class="text Esth-3-10" id="en-CEV-10959"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>The king handed his official ring to Haman, who hated the Jews, and the king told him, </span> <span class="text Esth-3-11" id="en-CEV-10960"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>“Do what you want with those people! You can keep their money.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Esth-3-12" id="en-CEV-10961"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>On the thirteenth day of Nisan, Haman called in the king's secretaries and ordered them to write letters in every language used in the kingdom. The letters were written in the name of the king and sealed by using the king's own ring.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-10961e" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-10961e" title="See footnote e"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-10961e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> At once they were sent to the king's highest officials, the governors of each province, and the leaders of the different nations in the kingdom of Xerxes.</span></p> <p><span class="text Esth-3-13" id="en-CEV-10962"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>The letters were taken by messengers to every part of the kingdom, and this is what was said in the letters:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Esth-3-13">On the thirteenth day of Adar, the twelfth month, all Jewish men, women, and children are to be killed.

The king's command was obeyed, and one of the letters was read aloud to the people in the walled city of Susa.
