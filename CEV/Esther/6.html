<h3><span class="text Esth-6-1" id="en-CEV-10994">The King Honors Mordecai</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Esth-6-1"><span class="chapternum">6 </span>That night the king could not sleep, and he had a servant read him the records of what had happened since he had been king. </span> <span class="text Esth-6-2" id="en-CEV-10995"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup> When the servant read how Mordecai had kept Bigthana and Teresh from killing the king, </span> <span class="text Esth-6-3" id="en-CEV-10996"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>the king asked, “What has been done to reward Mordecai for this?”</span></p><p><span class="text Esth-6-3">“Nothing, Your Majesty!” the king's servants replied.</span></p> <p><span class="text Esth-6-4" id="en-CEV-10997"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>About this time, Haman came in to ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on the gallows he had built. The king saw him and asked, “Who is that man waiting in front of the throne room?”</span></p> <p><span class="text Esth-6-5" id="en-CEV-10998"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>The king's servants answered, “Your Majesty, it is Haman.”</span></p><p><span class="text Esth-6-5">“Tell him to come in,” the king commanded.</span></p> <p><span class="text Esth-6-6" id="en-CEV-10999"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>When Haman entered the room, the king asked him, “What should I do for a man I want to honor?”</span></p><p><span class="text Esth-6-6">Haman was sure that he was the one the king wanted to honor. </span> <span class="text Esth-6-7" id="en-CEV-11000"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>So he replied, “Your Majesty, if you wish to honor a man, </span> <span class="text Esth-6-8" id="en-CEV-11001"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>get someone to bring him one of your own robes and one of your own horses with a fancy headdress. </span> <span class="text Esth-6-9" id="en-CEV-11002"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Tell one of your highest officials to place your robe on this man and lead him through the streets on your horse, while someone shouts, ‘This is how the king honors a man!’ ”</span></p> <p><span class="text Esth-6-10" id="en-CEV-11003"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>The king replied, “Hurry and do just what you have said! Don't forget a thing. Get the robe and the horse for Mordecai the Jew, who serves as one of the king's officials!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Esth-6-11" id="en-CEV-11004"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Haman got the king's robe and put it on Mordecai. He led him through the city on the horse and shouted as he went, “This is how the king honors a man!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Esth-6-12" id="en-CEV-11005"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Afterwards, Mordecai returned to his duties in the king's palace, and Haman hurried home, hiding his face in shame. </span> <span class="text Esth-6-13" id="en-CEV-11006"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Haman told his wife and friends what had happened. Then his wife and his advisors said, “If Mordecai is a Jew, this is just the beginning of your troubles! You will end up a ruined man.” </span> <span class="text Esth-6-14" id="en-CEV-11007"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>They were still talking, when the king's servants came and quickly took Haman to the dinner that Esther had prepared.</span></p>  <!--end of crossrefs-->
