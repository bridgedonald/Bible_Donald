<h3><span class="text Esth-9-1" id="en-CEV-11032">The Jews Destroy Their Enemies</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Esth-9-1"><span class="chapternum">9 </span>The first law that the king had made was to be followed on the thirteenth day of Adar,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-11032a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-11032a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-11032a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> the twelfth month. This was the very day that the enemies of the Jews had hoped to do away with them. But the Jews turned things around, </span> <span class="text Esth-9-2" id="en-CEV-11033"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>and in the cities of every province they came together to attack their enemies. Everyone was afraid of the Jews, and no one could do anything to oppose them.</span></p> <p><span class="text Esth-9-3" id="en-CEV-11034"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>The leaders of the provinces, the rulers, the governors, and the court officials were afraid of Mordecai and took sides with the Jews. </span> <span class="text Esth-9-4" id="en-CEV-11035"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Everyone in the provinces knew that the king had promoted him and had given him a lot of power.</span></p> <p><span class="text Esth-9-5" id="en-CEV-11036"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>The Jews took their swords and did away with their enemies, without showing any mercy. </span> <span class="text Esth-9-6-Esth-9-10" id="en-CEV-11037"><sup class="versenum">6-10 </sup>They killed 500 people in Susa,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-11037b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-11037b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-11037b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> but they did not take anything that belonged to the ones they killed. Haman had been one of the worst enemies of the Jews, and ten of his sons were among those who were killed. Their names were Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha.</span></p> <p><span class="text Esth-9-11" id="en-CEV-11038"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Later that day, someone told the king how many people had been killed in Susa.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-11038c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-11038c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-11038c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Esth-9-12" id="en-CEV-11039"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Then he told Esther, “Five hundred people, including Haman's ten sons, have been killed in Susa alone. If that many were killed here, what must have happened in the provinces? Is there anything else you want done? Just tell me, and it will be done.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Esth-9-13" id="en-CEV-11040"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Esther answered, “Your Majesty, please let the Jews in Susa fight to defend themselves tomorrow, just as they did today. And order the bodies of Haman's ten sons to be hanged in public.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Esth-9-14" id="en-CEV-11041"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>King Xerxes did what Esther had requested, and the bodies of Haman's sons were hung in Susa. </span> <span class="text Esth-9-15" id="en-CEV-11042"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Then on the fourteenth day of Adar the Jews of the city got together and killed 300 more people. But they still did not take anything that belonged to their enemies.</span></p> <p><span class="text Esth-9-16-Esth-9-17" id="en-CEV-11043"><sup class="versenum">16-17 </sup>On the thirteenth day of Adar, the Jews in the provinces had come together to defend themselves. They killed 75,000 of their enemies, but the Jews did not take anything that belonged to the ones they killed. Then on the fourteenth day of the month the Jews celebrated with a feast.</span></p> <p><span class="text Esth-9-18" id="en-CEV-11044"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup> On the fifteenth day of the month the Jews in Susa held a holiday and celebrated, after killing their enemies on the thirteenth and the fourteenth. </span> <span class="text Esth-9-19" id="en-CEV-11045"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>This is why the Jews in the villages now celebrate on the fourteenth day of the month.

Then he sent letters to the Jews everywhere in the provinces </span> <span class="text Esth-9-21" id="en-CEV-11047"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>and told them:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Esth-9-21">Each year you must celebrate on both the fourteenth and the fifteenth of Adar, </span> <span class="text Esth-9-22" id="en-CEV-11048"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>the days when we Jews defeated our enemies. Remember this month as a time when our sorrow was turned to joy, and celebration took the place of crying. Celebrate by having parties and by giving to the poor and by sharing gifts of food with each other.</span></p> <p><span class="text Esth-9-23" id="en-CEV-11049"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>They followed Mordecai's instructions and set aside these two days every year as a time of celebration.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Esth-9-24" id="en-CEV-11050">The Reason for the Festival of Purim</span></h3><p><span class="text Esth-9-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup> Haman was the son of Hammedatha and a descendant of Agag. He hated the Jews so much that he planned to destroy them, but he wanted to find out the best time to do it. So he cast lots.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-11050d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-11050d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-11050d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text Esth-9-25" id="en-CEV-11051"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Esther went to King Xerxes and asked him to save her people. Then the king gave written orders for Haman and his sons to be punished in the same terrible way that Haman had in mind for the Jews. So they were hanged. </span> <span class="text Esth-9-26" id="en-CEV-11052"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>Mordecai's letter had said that the Jews must celebrate for two days because of what had happened to them.
