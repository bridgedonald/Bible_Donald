<h3><span class="text 1Kgs-18-1-1Kgs-18-2" id="en-CEV-8002">Elijah Proves He Is the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s Prophet</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text 1Kgs-18-1-1Kgs-18-2"><span class="chapternum">18 </span><sup class="versenum">1-2 </sup>For three years no rain fell in Samaria, and there was almost nothing to eat anywhere. The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to Elijah, “Go and meet with King Ahab. I will soon make it rain.” So Elijah went to see Ahab.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-3-1Kgs-18-4" id="en-CEV-8003"><sup class="versenum">3-4 </sup>At that time Obadiah was in charge of Ahab's palace, but he faithfully worshiped the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>. In fact, when Jezebel was trying to kill the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s prophets, Obadiah hid 100 of them in two caves and gave them food and water.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-3-1Kgs-18-4">Ahab sent for Obadiah </span> <span class="text 1Kgs-18-5" id="en-CEV-8004"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>and said, “We have to find something for our horses and mules to eat. If we don't, we will have to kill them. Let's look around every creek and spring in the country for some grass. </span> <span class="text 1Kgs-18-6" id="en-CEV-8005"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>You go one way, and I'll go the other.” Then they left in separate directions.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-7" id="en-CEV-8006"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>As Obadiah was walking along, he met Elijah. Obadiah recognized him, bowed down, and asked, “Elijah, is it really you?”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-8" id="en-CEV-8007"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>“Yes. Go tell Ahab I'm here.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-9" id="en-CEV-8008"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Obadiah replied:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Kgs-18-9">King Ahab would kill me if I told him that. And I haven't even done anything wrong. </span> <span class="text 1Kgs-18-10" id="en-CEV-8009"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>I swear to you in the name of the living <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> your God that the king has looked everywhere for you. He sent people to look in every country, and when they couldn't find you, he made the leader of each country swear that you were not in that country. </span> <span class="text 1Kgs-18-11" id="en-CEV-8010"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Do you really want me to tell him you're here?</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Kgs-18-12" id="en-CEV-8011"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>What if the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s Spirit takes you away as soon as I leave? When Ahab comes to get you, he won't find you. Then he will surely kill me.</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Kgs-18-12">I have worshiped the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> since I was a boy. </span> <span class="text 1Kgs-18-13" id="en-CEV-8012"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>I even hid 100 of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s prophets in caves when Jezebel was trying to kill them. I also gave them food and water. </span> <span class="text 1Kgs-18-14" id="en-CEV-8013"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Do you really want me to tell Ahab you're here? He will kill me!</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-15" id="en-CEV-8014"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Elijah said, “I'm a servant of the living <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> All-Powerful, and I swear in his name that I will meet with Ahab today.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-16" id="en-CEV-8015"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Obadiah left and told Ahab where to find Elijah.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-16">Ahab went to meet Elijah, </span> <span class="text 1Kgs-18-17" id="en-CEV-8016"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>and when he saw him, Ahab shouted, “There you are, the biggest troublemaker in Israel!”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-18" id="en-CEV-8017"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Elijah answered:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Kgs-18-18">You're the troublemaker—not me! You and your family have disobeyed the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s commands by worshiping Baal.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Kgs-18-19" id="en-CEV-8018"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Call together everyone from Israel to meet me on Mount Carmel. Be sure to bring along the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of Asherah who eat at Jezebel's table.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-20" id="en-CEV-8019"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Ahab got everyone together, then they went to meet Elijah on Mount Carmel. </span> <span class="text 1Kgs-18-21" id="en-CEV-8020"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Elijah stood in front of them and said, “How much longer will you try to have things both ways? If the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> is God, worship him! But if Baal is God, worship him!”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-21">The people did not say a word.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-22" id="en-CEV-8021"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Then Elijah continued:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Kgs-18-22">I am the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s only prophet, but Baal has 450 prophets.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Kgs-18-23" id="en-CEV-8022"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>Bring us two bulls. Baal's prophets can take one of them, kill it, and cut it into pieces. Then they can put the meat on the wood without lighting the fire. I will do the same thing with the other bull, and I won't light a fire under it either.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Kgs-18-24" id="en-CEV-8023"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>The prophets of Baal will pray to their god, and I will pray to the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>. The one who answers by starting the fire is God.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-24">“That's a good idea,” everyone agreed.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-25" id="en-CEV-8024"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Elijah said to Baal's prophets, “There are more of you, so you go first. Pick out a bull and get it ready, but don't light the fire. Then pray to your god.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-26" id="en-CEV-8025"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>They chose their bull, then they got it ready and prayed to Baal all morning, asking him to start the fire. They danced around the altar and shouted, “Answer us, Baal!” But there was no answer.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-27" id="en-CEV-8026"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>At noon, Elijah began making fun of them. “Pray louder!” he said. “Baal must be a god. Maybe he's daydreaming or using the toilet or traveling somewhere. Or maybe he's asleep, and you have to wake him up.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-28" id="en-CEV-8027"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>The prophets kept shouting louder and louder, and they cut themselves with swords and knives until they were bleeding. This was the way they worshiped, </span> <span class="text 1Kgs-18-29" id="en-CEV-8028"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>and they kept it up until time for the evening sacrifice. But there was no answer of any kind.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-30" id="en-CEV-8029"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>Elijah told everyone to gather around him while he repaired the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s altar. </span> <span class="text 1Kgs-18-31-1Kgs-18-32" id="en-CEV-8030"><sup class="versenum">31-32 </sup> Then he used twelve stones to build an altar in honor of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>. Each stone stood for one of the tribes of Israel, which was the name the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had given to their ancestor Jacob. Elijah dug a ditch around the altar, large enough to hold about 14 liters. </span> <span class="text 1Kgs-18-33" id="en-CEV-8031"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>He placed the wood on the altar, then they cut the bull into pieces and laid the meat on the wood.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-33">He told the people, “Fill four large jars with water and pour it over the meat and the wood.” After they did this, </span> <span class="text 1Kgs-18-34" id="en-CEV-8032"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>he told them to do it two more times. They did exactly as he said </span> <span class="text 1Kgs-18-35" id="en-CEV-8033"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>until finally, the water ran down the altar and filled the ditch.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-36" id="en-CEV-8034"><sup class="versenum">36 </sup>When it was time for the evening sacrifice, Elijah prayed:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Kgs-18-36">Our <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, you are the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel. Now, prove that you are the God of this nation,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-8034a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-8034a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-8034a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> and that I, your servant, have done this at your command. </span> <span class="text 1Kgs-18-37" id="en-CEV-8035"><sup class="versenum">37 </sup>Please answer me, so these people will know that you are the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God, and that you will turn their hearts back to you.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-8035b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-8035b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-8035b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-38" id="en-CEV-8036"><sup class="versenum">38 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> immediately sent fire, and it burned up the sacrifice, the wood, and the stones. It scorched the ground everywhere around the altar and dried up every drop of water in the ditch. </span> <span class="text 1Kgs-18-39" id="en-CEV-8037"><sup class="versenum">39 </sup>When the crowd saw what had happened, they all bowed down and shouted, “The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> is God! The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> is God!”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-40" id="en-CEV-8038"><sup class="versenum">40 </sup>Just then, Elijah said, “Grab the prophets of Baal! Don't let any of them get away.”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-40">So the people captured the prophets and took them to Kishon River, where Elijah killed every one of them.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 1Kgs-18-41" id="en-CEV-8039">It Starts To Rain</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-41"><sup class="versenum">41 </sup>Elijah told Ahab, “Get something to eat and drink. I hear a heavy rain coming.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-42" id="en-CEV-8040"><sup class="versenum">42 </sup> Ahab left, but Elijah climbed back to the top of Mount Carmel. Then he stooped down with his face almost to the ground </span> <span class="text 1Kgs-18-43" id="en-CEV-8041"><sup class="versenum">43 </sup>and said to his servant, “Look toward the sea.”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-43">The servant left. And when he came back, he said, “I looked, but I didn't see anything.” Elijah told him to look seven more times.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-44" id="en-CEV-8042"><sup class="versenum">44 </sup>After the seventh time the servant replied, “I see a small cloud coming this way. But it's no bigger than a fist.”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-44">Elijah told him, “Tell Ahab to get his chariot ready and start home now. Otherwise, the rain will stop him.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-45-1Kgs-18-46" id="en-CEV-8043"><sup class="versenum">45-46 </sup>A few minutes later, it got very cloudy and windy, and rain started pouring down. So Elijah wrapped his coat around himself, and the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> gave him strength to run all the way to Jezreel. Ahab followed in his chariot.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
