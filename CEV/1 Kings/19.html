Now I'm going to kill you!

Finally, he came to a large bush and sat down in its shade. He begged the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, “I've had enough. Just let me die! I'm no better off than my ancestors.” </span> <span class="text 1Kgs-19-5" id="en-CEV-8048"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Then he lay down in the shade and fell asleep.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-19-5">Suddenly an angel woke him up and said, “Get up and eat.” </span> <span class="text 1Kgs-19-6" id="en-CEV-8049"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Elijah looked around, and by his head was a jar of water and some baked bread. He sat up, ate and drank, then lay down and went back to sleep.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-19-7" id="en-CEV-8050"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Soon the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s angel woke him again and said, “Get up and eat, or else you'll get too tired to travel.” </span> <span class="text 1Kgs-19-8" id="en-CEV-8051"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>So Elijah sat up and ate and drank.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-19-8">The food and water made him strong enough to walk 40 more days.
