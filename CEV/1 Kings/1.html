One day, Adonijah started bragging, “I'm going to make myself king!” So he got some chariots and horses, and he hired 50 men as bodyguards. David did not want to hurt his feelings, so he never asked Adonijah why he was doing these things.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-1-7" id="en-CEV-7445"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Adonijah met with Joab the son of Zeruiah and Abiathar the priest and asked them if they would help him become king.
