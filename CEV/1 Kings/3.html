Then I will know how to rule your people. If you don't, there is no way I could rule this great nation of yours.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-3-10-1Kgs-3-11" id="en-CEV-7543"><sup class="versenum">10-11 </sup>God said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Kgs-3-10-1Kgs-3-11">Solomon, I'm pleased that you asked for this. You could have asked to live a long time or to be rich. Or you could have asked for your enemies to be destroyed. Instead, you asked for wisdom to make right decisions. </span> <span class="text 1Kgs-3-12" id="en-CEV-7544"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>So I'll make you wiser than anyone who has ever lived or ever will live.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Kgs-3-13" id="en-CEV-7545"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>I'll also give you what you didn't ask for.
