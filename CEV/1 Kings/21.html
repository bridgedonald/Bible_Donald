<h3><span class="text 1Kgs-21-1" id="en-CEV-8107">Jezebel Has Naboth Killed</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text 1Kgs-21-1"><span class="chapternum">21 </span>Naboth owned a vineyard in Jezreel near King Ahab's palace.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-21-2" id="en-CEV-8108"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>One day, Ahab said, “Naboth, your vineyard is near my palace. Give it to me so I can turn it into a vegetable garden. I'll give you a better vineyard or pay whatever you want for yours.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-21-3" id="en-CEV-8109"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Naboth answered, “This vineyard has always been in my family. I won't let you have it.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-21-4" id="en-CEV-8110"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>So Ahab went home, angry and depressed because of what Naboth had told him. He lay on his bed, just staring at the wall and refusing to eat a thing.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-21-5" id="en-CEV-8111"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Jezebel his wife came in and asked, “What's wrong? Why won't you eat?”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-21-6" id="en-CEV-8112"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>“I asked Naboth to sell me his vineyard or to let me give him a better one,” Ahab replied. “And he told me I couldn't have it.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-21-7" id="en-CEV-8113"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>“Aren't you the king of Israel?” Jezebel asked. “Get out of bed and eat something! Don't worry, I'll get Naboth's vineyard for you.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-21-8-1Kgs-21-10" id="en-CEV-8114"><sup class="versenum">8-10 </sup>Jezebel wrote a letter to each of the leaders of the town where Naboth lived. In the letters she said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Kgs-21-8-1Kgs-21-10">Call everyone together and tell them to go without eating<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-8114a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-8114a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-8114a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> today. When they come together, give Naboth a seat at the front. Get two liars to sit facing him and swear that Naboth has cursed God and the king. Then take Naboth outside and stone him to death!</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-21-8-1Kgs-21-10">She signed Ahab's name to the letters and sealed them with his seal. Then she sent them to the town leaders.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-21-11" id="en-CEV-8115"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>After receiving her letters, they did exactly what she had asked. </span> <span class="text 1Kgs-21-12" id="en-CEV-8116"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>They told the people that it was a day to go without eating, and when they all came together, they seated Naboth at the front. </span> <span class="text 1Kgs-21-13" id="en-CEV-8117"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>The two liars came in and sat across from Naboth. Then they accused him of cursing God and the king, so the people dragged Naboth outside and stoned him to death.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-21-14" id="en-CEV-8118"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>The leaders of Jezreel sent a message back to Jezebel that said, “Naboth is dead.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-21-15" id="en-CEV-8119"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>As soon as Jezebel got their message, she told Ahab, “Now you can have the vineyard Naboth refused to sell. He's dead.” </span> <span class="text 1Kgs-21-16" id="en-CEV-8120"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Ahab got up and went to take over the vineyard.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 1Kgs-21-17" id="en-CEV-8121">Elijah Condemns Ahab</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Kgs-21-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to Elijah the prophet, </span> <span class="text 1Kgs-21-18" id="en-CEV-8122"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>“King Ahab of Israel is in Naboth's vineyard right now, taking it over. </span> <span class="text 1Kgs-21-19" id="en-CEV-8123"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Go tell him that I say, ‘Ahab, you murdered Naboth and took his property. And so, in the very spot where dogs licked up Naboth's blood, they will lick up your blood.’ ”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-21-19">When Elijah found him, </span> <span class="text 1Kgs-21-20" id="en-CEV-8124"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Ahab said, “So, my enemy, you found me at last.”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-21-20">Elijah answered:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Kgs-21-20">Yes, I did! Ahab, you have managed to do everything the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> hates. </span> <span class="text 1Kgs-21-21" id="en-CEV-8125"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Now you will be punished. You and every man and boy in your family will die, whether slave or free. </span> <span class="text 1Kgs-21-22" id="en-CEV-8126"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Your whole family will be wiped out, just like the families of King Jeroboam and King Baasha. You've made the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> very angry by sinning and causing the Israelites to sin.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text 1Kgs-21-23" id="en-CEV-8127"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup> And as for Jezebel, dogs will eat her body there in Jezreel. </span> <span class="text 1Kgs-21-24" id="en-CEV-8128"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>Dogs will also eat the bodies of your relatives who die in town, and vultures will eat the bodies of those who die in the country.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-21-25-1Kgs-21-29" id="en-CEV-8129"><sup class="versenum">25-29 </sup>When Ahab heard this, he tore his clothes in sorrow and wore sackcloth day and night. He was depressed and refused to eat.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-21-25-1Kgs-21-29">Some time later, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said, “Elijah, do you see how sorry Ahab is for what he did? I won't punish his family while he is still alive. I'll wait until his son is king.”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-21-25-1Kgs-21-29">No one was more determined than Ahab to disobey the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>. And Jezebel encouraged him. Worst of all, he had worshiped idols, just as the Amorites<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-8129b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-8129b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-8129b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> had done before the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> forced them out of the land and gave it to Israel.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
