<h3><span class="text Neh-6-1" id="en-CEV-10674">Plots against Nehemiah</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Neh-6-1"><span class="chapternum">6 </span>Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem, and our other enemies learned that I had completely rebuilt the wall. All I lacked was hanging the doors in the gates. </span> <span class="text Neh-6-2" id="en-CEV-10675"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Then Sanballat and Geshem sent a message, asking me to meet with them in one of the villages in Ono Valley. I knew they were planning to harm me in some way. </span> <span class="text Neh-6-3" id="en-CEV-10676"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>So I sent messengers to tell them, “My work is too important to stop now and go there. I can't afford to slow down the work just to visit with you.” </span> <span class="text Neh-6-4" id="en-CEV-10677"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>They invited me four times, but each time I refused to go.</span></p> <p><span class="text Neh-6-5" id="en-CEV-10678"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Finally, Sanballat sent an official to me with an unsealed letter, </span> <span class="text Neh-6-6" id="en-CEV-10679"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>which said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text Neh-6-6">A rumor is going around among the nations that you and the other Jews are rebuilding the wall and planning to rebel, because you want to be their king. And Geshem<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-10679a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-10679a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-10679a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> says it's true! </span> <span class="text Neh-6-7" id="en-CEV-10680"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>You even have prophets in Jerusalem, claiming you are now the king of Judah. You know the Persian king will hear about this, so let's get together and talk it over.</span></p> <p><span class="text Neh-6-8" id="en-CEV-10681"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>I sent a message back to Sanballat, saying, “None of this is true! You are making it all up.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Neh-6-9" id="en-CEV-10682"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Our enemies were trying to frighten us and to keep us from our work. But I asked God to give me strength.</span></p> <p><span class="text Neh-6-10" id="en-CEV-10683"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>One day I went to visit Shemaiah.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-10683b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-10683b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-10683b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> He wasn't supposed to leave his house, but he said, “Let's hurry to the holy place of the temple and hide there.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-10683c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-10683c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-10683c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> We will lock the temple doors, because your enemies are planning to kill you tonight.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Neh-6-11" id="en-CEV-10684"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>I answered, “Why should someone like me have to run and hide in the temple to save my life? I won't go!”</span></p> <p><span class="text Neh-6-12" id="en-CEV-10685"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Suddenly I realized that God had not given Shemaiah this message. But Tobiah and Sanballat had paid him to trick me </span> <span class="text Neh-6-13" id="en-CEV-10686"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>and to frighten me into doing something wrong, because they wanted to ruin my good name.</span></p> <p><span class="text Neh-6-14" id="en-CEV-10687"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Then I asked God to punish Tobiah and Sanballat for what they had done. I prayed that God would punish the prophet Noadiah and the other prophets who, together with her, had tried to frighten me.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Neh-6-15" id="en-CEV-10688">The Work Is Finished</span></h3><p><span class="text Neh-6-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>On the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-10688d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-10688d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-10688d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> the wall was completely rebuilt. It had taken 52 days. </span> <span class="text Neh-6-16" id="en-CEV-10689"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>When our enemies in the surrounding nations learned that the work was finished, they felt helpless, because they knew that our God had helped us rebuild the wall.</span></p> <p><span class="text Neh-6-17" id="en-CEV-10690"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>All this time the Jewish leaders and Tobiah had been writing letters back and forth. </span> <span class="text Neh-6-18" id="en-CEV-10691"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Many people in Judah were loyal to Tobiah for two reasons: Shecaniah son of Arah was his father-in-law, and Tobiah's son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-10691e" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-10691e" title="See footnote e"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-10691e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Neh-6-19" id="en-CEV-10692"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>The people would always tell me about the good things Tobiah had done, and then they would tell Tobiah everything I had said. So Tobiah kept sending letters, trying to frighten me.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
