So if someone is trapped in sin, you should gently lead that person back to the right path. But watch out, and don't be tempted yourself. </span> <span class="text Gal-6-2" id="en-CEV-27084"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>You obey the law of Christ when you offer each other a helping hand.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gal-6-3" id="en-CEV-27085"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>If you think you are better than others, when you really aren't, you are wrong. </span> <span class="text Gal-6-4" id="en-CEV-27086"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Do your own work well, and then you will have something to be proud of. But don't compare yourself with others. </span> <span class="text Gal-6-5" id="en-CEV-27087"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>We each must carry our own load.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gal-6-6" id="en-CEV-27088"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Share every good thing you have with anyone who teaches you what God has said.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gal-6-7" id="en-CEV-27089"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>You cannot fool God, so don't make a fool of yourself! You will harvest what you plant. </span> <span class="text Gal-6-8" id="en-CEV-27090"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>If you follow your selfish desires, you will harvest destruction, but if you follow the Spirit, you will harvest eternal life. </span> <span class="text Gal-6-9" id="en-CEV-27091"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Don't get tired of helping others. You will be rewarded when the time is right, if you don't give up. </span> <span class="text Gal-6-10" id="en-CEV-27092"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>We should help people whenever we can, especially if they are followers of the Lord.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Gal-6-11" id="en-CEV-27093">Final Warnings</span></h3><p><span class="text Gal-6-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>You can see what big letters I make when I write with my own hand.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gal-6-12" id="en-CEV-27094"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Those people who are telling you to get circumcised are only trying to show how important they are. And they don't want to get into trouble for preaching about the cross of Christ. </span> <span class="text Gal-6-13" id="en-CEV-27095"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>They are circumcised, but they don't obey the Law of Moses. All they want is to brag about having you circumcised. </span> <span class="text Gal-6-14" id="en-CEV-27096"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>But I will never brag about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. Because of his cross, the world is dead as far as I am concerned, and I am dead as far as the world is concerned.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gal-6-15" id="en-CEV-27097"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>It doesn't matter if you are circumcised or not. All that matters is that you are a new person.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gal-6-16" id="en-CEV-27098"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>If you follow this rule, you will belong to God's true people. God will treat you with undeserved kindness and will bless you with peace.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gal-6-17" id="en-CEV-27099"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup> On my own body are scars that prove I belong to Christ Jesus. So I don't want anyone to bother me anymore.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gal-6-18" id="en-CEV-27100"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>My friends, I pray that the Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you!
