<h3><span class="text Gal-5-1" id="en-CEV-27057">Christ Gives Freedom</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Gal-5-1"><span class="chapternum">5 </span>Christ has set us free! This means we are really free. Now hold on to your freedom and don't ever become slaves of the Law again.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gal-5-2" id="en-CEV-27058"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>I, Paul, promise you that Christ won't do you any good if you get circumcised. </span> <span class="text Gal-5-3" id="en-CEV-27059"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>If you do, you must obey the whole Law. </span> <span class="text Gal-5-4" id="en-CEV-27060"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>And if you try to please God by obeying the Law, you have cut yourself off from Christ and his gift of undeserved grace. </span> <span class="text Gal-5-5" id="en-CEV-27061"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>But the Spirit makes us sure God will accept us because of our faith in Christ. </span> <span class="text Gal-5-6" id="en-CEV-27062"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>If you are a follower of Christ Jesus, it makes no difference whether you are circumcised or not. All that matters is your faith that makes you love others.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gal-5-7" id="en-CEV-27063"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>You were doing so well until someone made you turn from the truth. </span> <span class="text Gal-5-8" id="en-CEV-27064"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>And that person was certainly not sent by the one who chose you. </span> <span class="text Gal-5-9" id="en-CEV-27065"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup> A little yeast can change a whole batch of dough, </span> <span class="text Gal-5-10" id="en-CEV-27066"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>but you belong to the Lord. This makes me certain you will do what I say, instead of what someone else tells you to do. Whoever is causing trouble for you will be punished.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gal-5-11" id="en-CEV-27067"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>My friends, if I still preach that people need to be circumcised, why am I in so much trouble? The message about the cross would no longer be a problem, if I told people to be circumcised. </span> <span class="text Gal-5-12" id="en-CEV-27068"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>I wish everyone who is upsetting you would not only get circumcised, but would cut off much more!</span></p> <p><span class="text Gal-5-13" id="en-CEV-27069"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>My friends, you were chosen to be free. So don't use your freedom as an excuse to do anything you want. Use it as an opportunity to serve each other with love. </span> <span class="text Gal-5-14" id="en-CEV-27070"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup> All the Law says can be summed up in the command to love others as much as you love yourself. </span> <span class="text Gal-5-15" id="en-CEV-27071"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>But if you keep attacking each other like wild animals, you had better watch out or you will destroy yourselves.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Gal-5-16" id="en-CEV-27072">God's Spirit and Our Own Desires</span></h3><p><span class="text Gal-5-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>If you are guided by the Spirit, you won't obey your selfish desires. </span> <span class="text Gal-5-17" id="en-CEV-27073"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup> The Spirit and your desires are enemies of each other. They are always fighting each other and keeping you from doing what you feel you should. </span> <span class="text Gal-5-18" id="en-CEV-27074"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>But if you obey the Spirit, the Law of Moses has no control over you.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gal-5-19" id="en-CEV-27075"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>People's desires make them give in to immoral ways, filthy thoughts, and shameful deeds. </span> <span class="text Gal-5-20" id="en-CEV-27076"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>They worship idols, practice witchcraft, hate others, and are hard to get along with. People become jealous, angry, and selfish. They not only argue and cause trouble, but they are </span> <span class="text Gal-5-21" id="en-CEV-27077"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>envious. They get drunk, carry on at wild parties, and do other evil things as well. I told you before, and I am telling you again: No one who does these things will share in the blessings of God's kingdom.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gal-5-22" id="en-CEV-27078"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>God's Spirit makes us loving, happy, peaceful, patient, kind, good, faithful, </span> <span class="text Gal-5-23" id="en-CEV-27079"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>gentle, and self-controlled. There is no law against behaving in any of these ways. </span> <span class="text Gal-5-24" id="en-CEV-27080"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>And because we belong to Christ Jesus, we have killed our selfish feelings and desires. </span> <span class="text Gal-5-25" id="en-CEV-27081"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>God's Spirit has given us life, and so we should follow the Spirit. </span> <span class="text Gal-5-26" id="en-CEV-27082"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>But don't be conceited or make others jealous by claiming to be better than they are.</span></p>  <!--end of crossrefs-->
