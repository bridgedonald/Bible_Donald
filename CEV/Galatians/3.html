<h3><span class="text Gal-3-1" id="en-CEV-26997">Faith Is the Only Way</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Gal-3-1"><span class="chapternum">3 </span>You stupid Galatians! I told you exactly how Jesus Christ was nailed to a cross. Has someone now put an evil spell on you? </span> <span class="text Gal-3-2" id="en-CEV-26998"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>I want to know only one thing. How were you given God's Spirit? Was it by obeying the Law of Moses or by hearing about Christ and having faith in him? </span> <span class="text Gal-3-3" id="en-CEV-26999"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>How can you be so stupid? Do you think that by yourself you can complete what God's Spirit started in you? </span> <span class="text Gal-3-4" id="en-CEV-27000"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Have you gone through all of this for nothing? Is it all really for nothing? </span> <span class="text Gal-3-5" id="en-CEV-27001"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>God gives you his Spirit and works miracles in you. But does he do this because you obey the Law of Moses or because you have heard about Christ and have faith in him?</span></p> <p><span class="text Gal-3-6" id="en-CEV-27002"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup> The Scriptures say that God accepted Abraham because Abraham had faith. </span> <span class="text Gal-3-7" id="en-CEV-27003"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup> And so, you should understand that everyone who has faith is a child of Abraham.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27003a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27003a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27003a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Gal-3-8" id="en-CEV-27004"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup> Long ago the Scriptures said God would accept the Gentiles because of their faith. This is why God told Abraham the good news that all nations would be blessed because of him. </span> <span class="text Gal-3-9" id="en-CEV-27005"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>This means everyone who has faith will share in the blessings given to Abraham because of his faith.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gal-3-10" id="en-CEV-27006"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup> Anyone who tries to please God by obeying the Law is under a curse. The Scriptures say, “Everyone who doesn't obey everything in the Law is under a curse.” </span> <span class="text Gal-3-11" id="en-CEV-27007"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup> No one can please God by obeying the Law. The Scriptures also say, “The people God accepts because of their faith will live.”<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27007b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27007b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27007b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text Gal-3-12" id="en-CEV-27008"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup> The Law isn't based on faith. It promises life only to people who obey its commands. </span> <span class="text Gal-3-13" id="en-CEV-27009"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup> But Christ rescued us from the Law's curse, when he became a curse in our place. This is because the Scriptures say that anyone who is nailed to a tree is under a curse. </span> <span class="text Gal-3-14" id="en-CEV-27010"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>And because of what Jesus Christ has done, the blessing promised to Abraham was taken to the Gentiles. This happened so that by faith we would be given the promised Holy Spirit.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Gal-3-15" id="en-CEV-27011">The Law and the Promise</span></h3><p><span class="text Gal-3-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>My friends, I will use an everyday example to explain what I mean. Once someone agrees to something, no one else can change or cancel the agreement.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27011c" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27011c" title="See footnote c"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27011c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Gal-3-16" id="en-CEV-27012"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>That is how it is with the promises God made to Abraham and his descendant.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27012d" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27012d" title="See footnote d"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27012d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> The promises were not made to many descendants, but only to one, and that one is Christ. </span> <span class="text Gal-3-17" id="en-CEV-27013"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup> What I am saying is that the Law cannot change or cancel God's promise made 430 years before the Law was given. </span> <span class="text Gal-3-18" id="en-CEV-27014"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup> If we have to obey the Law in order to receive God's blessings, those blessings don't really come to us because of God's promise. But God was kind to Abraham and made him a promise.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gal-3-19" id="en-CEV-27015"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>What is the use of the Law? It was given later to show that we sin. But it was only supposed to last until the coming of that descendant<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27015e" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27015e" title="See footnote e"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27015e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> who was given the promise. In fact, angels gave the Law to Moses, and he gave it to the people. </span> <span class="text Gal-3-20" id="en-CEV-27016"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>There is only one God, and the Law did not come directly from him.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Gal-3-21" id="en-CEV-27017">Slaves and Children</span></h3><p><span class="text Gal-3-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Does the Law disagree with God's promises? No, it doesn't! If any law could give life to us, we could become acceptable to God by obeying that law. </span> <span class="text Gal-3-22" id="en-CEV-27018"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>But the Scriptures say that sin controls everyone, so that God's promises will be for anyone who has faith in Jesus Christ.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gal-3-23" id="en-CEV-27019"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>The Law controlled us and kept us under its power until the time came when we would have faith. </span> <span class="text Gal-3-24" id="en-CEV-27020"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>In fact, the Law was to be our teacher until Christ came. Then we could have faith and be acceptable to God. </span> <span class="text Gal-3-25" id="en-CEV-27021"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>But once a person has learned to have faith, there is no more need to have the Law as a teacher.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gal-3-26" id="en-CEV-27022"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>All of you are God's children because of your faith in Christ Jesus. </span> <span class="text Gal-3-27" id="en-CEV-27023"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>And when you were baptized, it was as though you had put on Christ in the same way you put on new clothes. </span> <span class="text Gal-3-28" id="en-CEV-27024"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>Faith in Christ Jesus is what makes each of you equal with each other, whether you are a Jew or a Greek, a slave or a free person, a man or a woman. </span> <span class="text Gal-3-29" id="en-CEV-27025"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup> So if you belong to Christ, you are now part of Abraham's family,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27025f" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27025f" title="See footnote f"&gt;f&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27025f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> and you will be given what God has promised. </span> </p><div class="footnotes">
