<p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Gal-1-1-Gal-1-2" id="en-CEV-26953"><span class="chapternum">1 </span><sup class="versenum">1-2 </sup>From the apostle Paul and from all the Lord's followers with me.</span></p><p><span class="text Gal-1-1-Gal-1-2">I was chosen to be an apostle by Jesus Christ and by God the Father, who raised him from death. No mere human chose or appointed me to this work.</span></p><p><span class="text Gal-1-1-Gal-1-2">To the churches in Galatia:</span></p> <p><span class="text Gal-1-3" id="en-CEV-26954"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>I pray that God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you and will bless you with peace! </span> <span class="text Gal-1-4" id="en-CEV-26955"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Christ obeyed God our Father and gave himself as a sacrifice for our sins to rescue us from this evil world. </span> <span class="text Gal-1-5" id="en-CEV-26956"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>God will be given glory forever and ever. Amen.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Gal-1-6" id="en-CEV-26957">The Only True Message</span></h3><p><span class="text Gal-1-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>I am shocked that you have so quickly turned from God, who chose you with his gift of undeserved grace.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-26957a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-26957a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-26957a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> You have believed another message, </span> <span class="text Gal-1-7" id="en-CEV-26958"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>when there is really only one true message. But some people are causing you trouble and want to make you turn away from the good news about Christ. </span> <span class="text Gal-1-8" id="en-CEV-26959"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>I pray that God will punish anyone who preaches anything different from our message to you! It doesn't matter if that person is one of us or an angel from heaven. </span> <span class="text Gal-1-9" id="en-CEV-26960"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>I have said it before, and I will say it again. I hope God will punish anyone who preaches anything different from what you have already believed.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gal-1-10" id="en-CEV-26961"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>I am not trying to please people. I want to please God. Do you think I am trying to please people? If I were doing that, I would not be a servant of Christ.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Gal-1-11" id="en-CEV-26962">How Paul Became an Apostle</span></h3><p><span class="text Gal-1-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>My friends, I want you to know that no one made up the message I preach. </span> <span class="text Gal-1-12" id="en-CEV-26963"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>It wasn't given or taught to me by some mere human. My message came directly from Jesus Christ when he appeared to me.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gal-1-13" id="en-CEV-26964"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup> You know how I used to live as a Jew. I was cruel to God's church and even tried to destroy it. </span> <span class="text Gal-1-14" id="en-CEV-26965"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup> I was a much better Jew than anyone else my own age, and I obeyed every law our ancestors had given us. </span> <span class="text Gal-1-15" id="en-CEV-26966"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup> But even before I was born, God had chosen me by his gift of undeserved grace and had decided </span> <span class="text Gal-1-16" id="en-CEV-26967"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>to show me his Son, so I would announce his message to the Gentiles. I didn't talk this over with anyone. </span> <span class="text Gal-1-17" id="en-CEV-26968"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>I didn't say a word, not even to the men in Jerusalem who were apostles before I was. Instead, I went at once to Arabia, and afterwards I returned to Damascus.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gal-1-18" id="en-CEV-26969"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup> Three years later I went to visit Peter<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-26969b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-26969b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-26969b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> in Jerusalem and stayed with him for 15 days. </span> <span class="text Gal-1-19" id="en-CEV-26970"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>The only other apostle I saw was James, the Lord's brother. </span> <span class="text Gal-1-20" id="en-CEV-26971"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>And in the presence of God I swear I am telling the truth.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gal-1-21" id="en-CEV-26972"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Later, I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia. </span> <span class="text Gal-1-22" id="en-CEV-26973"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>But no one who belonged to Christ's churches in Judea had ever seen me in person. </span> <span class="text Gal-1-23" id="en-CEV-26974"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>They had only heard that the one who had been cruel to them was now preaching the message that he had once tried to destroy. </span> <span class="text Gal-1-24" id="en-CEV-26975"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>And because of me, they praised God.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
