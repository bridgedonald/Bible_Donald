<p> <span class="text Gal-4-1" id="en-CEV-27026"><span class="chapternum mid-paragraph">4 </span><sup class="versenum mid-paragraph">1 </sup>Children who are under age are no better off than slaves, even though everything their parents own will someday be theirs. </span> <span class="text Gal-4-2" id="en-CEV-27027"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>This is because children are placed in the care of guardians and teachers until the time their parents have set. </span> <span class="text Gal-4-3" id="en-CEV-27028"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>This is how it was with us. We were like children ruled by the powers of this world.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gal-4-4" id="en-CEV-27029"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>But when the time was right, God sent his Son, and a woman gave birth to him. His Son obeyed the Law, </span> <span class="text Gal-4-5" id="en-CEV-27030"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup> so he could set us free from the Law, and we could become God's children. </span> <span class="text Gal-4-6" id="en-CEV-27031"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup> Now that we are his children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts. And his Spirit tells us that God is our Father. </span> <span class="text Gal-4-7" id="en-CEV-27032"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>You are no longer slaves. You are God's children, and you will be given what he has promised.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Gal-4-8" id="en-CEV-27033">Paul's Concern for the Galatians</span></h3><p><span class="text Gal-4-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Before you knew God, you were slaves of gods that are not real. </span> <span class="text Gal-4-9" id="en-CEV-27034"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>But now you know God, or better still, God knows you. How can you turn back and become the slaves of those weak and pitiful powers?<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27034a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27034a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27034a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text Gal-4-10" id="en-CEV-27035"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>You even celebrate certain days, months, seasons, and years. </span> <span class="text Gal-4-11" id="en-CEV-27036"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>I am afraid I have wasted my time working with you.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gal-4-12" id="en-CEV-27037"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>My friends, I beg you to be like me, just as I once tried to be like you. Did you mistreat me </span> <span class="text Gal-4-13" id="en-CEV-27038"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>when I first preached to you? No you didn't, even though you knew I had come there because I was sick. </span> <span class="text Gal-4-14" id="en-CEV-27039"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>My illness must have caused you some trouble, but you didn't hate me or turn me away because of it. You welcomed me as though I were one of God's angels or even Christ Jesus himself. </span> <span class="text Gal-4-15" id="en-CEV-27040"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Where is that good feeling now? I am sure if it had been possible, you would have taken out your own eyes and given them to me. </span> <span class="text Gal-4-16" id="en-CEV-27041"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Am I now your enemy, just because I told you the truth?</span></p> <p><span class="text Gal-4-17" id="en-CEV-27042"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Those people may be paying you a lot of attention, but it isn't for your good. They only want to keep you away from me, so you will pay them a lot of attention. </span> <span class="text Gal-4-18" id="en-CEV-27043"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>It is always good to give your attention to something worthwhile, even when I am not with you. </span> <span class="text Gal-4-19" id="en-CEV-27044"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>My children, I am in terrible pain until Christ may be seen living in you. </span> <span class="text Gal-4-20" id="en-CEV-27045"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>I wish I were with you now. Then I would not have to talk this way. You really have me puzzled.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Gal-4-21" id="en-CEV-27046">Hagar and Sarah</span></h3><p><span class="text Gal-4-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Some of you would like to be under the rule of the Law of Moses. But do you know what the Law says? </span> <span class="text Gal-4-22" id="en-CEV-27047"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup> In the Scriptures we learn that Abraham had two sons. The mother of one of them was a slave, while the mother of the other one had always been free. </span> <span class="text Gal-4-23" id="en-CEV-27048"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>The son of the slave woman was born in the usual way. But the son of the free woman was born because of God's promise.</span></p> <p><span class="text Gal-4-24" id="en-CEV-27049"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>All of this has another meaning as well. Each of the two women stands for one of the agreements God made with his people. Hagar, the slave woman, stands for the agreement that was made at Mount Sinai. Everyone born into her family is a slave. </span> <span class="text Gal-4-25" id="en-CEV-27050"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Hagar also stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-27050b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-27050b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-27050b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> and for the present city of Jerusalem.
