<h3><span class="text 2Cor-13-1" id="en-CEV-26940">Final Warnings and Greetings</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text 2Cor-13-1"><span class="chapternum">13 </span> I am on my way to visit you for the third time. And as the Scriptures say, “Any charges must be proved true by at least two or three witnesses.” </span> <span class="text 2Cor-13-2" id="en-CEV-26941"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>During my second visit I warned you that I would punish you and anyone else who doesn't stop sinning. I am far away from you now, but I give you the same warning. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-13-3" id="en-CEV-26942"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>This should prove to you that I am speaking for Christ. When he corrects you, he won't be weak. He will be powerful! </span> <span class="text 2Cor-13-4" id="en-CEV-26943"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Although he was weak when he was nailed to the cross, he now lives by the power of God. We are weak, just as Christ was. But you will see that we will live by the power of God, just as Christ does.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-13-5" id="en-CEV-26944"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Test yourselves and find out if you really are true to your faith. If you pass the test, you will discover that Christ is living in you. But if Christ isn't living in you, you have failed. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-13-6" id="en-CEV-26945"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>I hope you will discover we have not failed. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-13-7" id="en-CEV-26946"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>We pray you will stop doing evil things. We don't pray like this to make ourselves look good, but to get you to do right, even if we are failures.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-13-8" id="en-CEV-26947"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>All we can do is to follow the truth and not fight against it. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-13-9" id="en-CEV-26948"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Even though we are weak, we are glad that you are strong, and we pray you will do even better. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-13-10" id="en-CEV-26949"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>I am writing these things to you before I arrive. This way I won't have to be hard on you when I use the authority the Lord has given me. I was given this authority, so I could help you and not destroy you.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-13-11" id="en-CEV-26950"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Goodbye, my friends. Do better and pay attention to what I have said. Try to get along and live peacefully with each other.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Cor-13-11">Now I pray that God, who gives love and peace, will be with you. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-13-12" id="en-CEV-26951"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Give each other a warm greeting. All God's people send their greetings.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-13-13" id="en-CEV-26952"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>I pray that the Lord Jesus Christ will bless you and be kind to you! May God bless you with his love, and may the Holy Spirit join all your hearts together.</span></p>  <!--end of crossrefs-->
