<h3><span class="text 2Cor-4-1" id="en-CEV-26757">Treasure in Clay Jars</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text 2Cor-4-1"><span class="chapternum">4 </span>God has been kind enough to trust us with this work. This is why we never give up. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-4-2" id="en-CEV-26758"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>We don't do shameful things that must be kept secret. And we don't try to fool anyone or twist God's message around. God is our witness that we speak only the truth, so others will be sure we can be trusted. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-4-3" id="en-CEV-26759"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>If there is anything hidden about our message, it is hidden only to someone who is lost.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-4-4" id="en-CEV-26760"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>The god who rules this world has blinded the minds of unbelievers. They cannot see the light, which is the good news about our glorious Christ, who shows what God is like. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-4-5" id="en-CEV-26761"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>We are not preaching about ourselves. Our message is that Jesus Christ is Lord. He also sent us to be your servants. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-4-6" id="en-CEV-26762"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup> The Scriptures say, “God commanded light to shine in the dark.” Now God is shining in our hearts to let you know that his glory is seen in Jesus Christ.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-4-7" id="en-CEV-26763"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>We are like clay jars in which this treasure is stored. The real power comes from God and not from us. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-4-8" id="en-CEV-26764"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>We often suffer, but we are never crushed. Even when we don't know what to do, we never give up. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-4-9" id="en-CEV-26765"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>In times of trouble, God is with us, and when we are knocked down, we get up again. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-4-10-2Cor-4-11" id="en-CEV-26766"><sup class="versenum">10-11 </sup>We face death every day because of Jesus. Our bodies show what his death was like, so his life can also be seen in us. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-4-12" id="en-CEV-26767"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>This means that death is working in us, but life is working in you.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-4-13" id="en-CEV-26768"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>In the Scriptures it says, “I spoke because I had faith.” We have this same kind of faith. So we speak </span> <span class="text 2Cor-4-14" id="en-CEV-26769"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>because we know that God raised the Lord Jesus to life. And just as God raised Jesus, he will also raise us to life. Then he will bring us into his presence together with you. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-4-15" id="en-CEV-26770"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>All of this has been done for you, so more and more people will know how kind God is and will praise and honor him.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 2Cor-4-16" id="en-CEV-26771">Faith in the Lord</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Cor-4-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>We never give up. Our bodies are gradually dying, but we ourselves are being made stronger each day. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-4-17" id="en-CEV-26772"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>These little troubles are getting us ready for an eternal glory that will make all our troubles seem like nothing. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-4-18" id="en-CEV-26773"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Things that are seen don't last forever, but things that are not seen are eternal. This is why we keep our minds on the things that cannot be seen.</span></p>  <!--end of crossrefs-->
