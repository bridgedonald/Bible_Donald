<h3><span class="text 2Cor-10-1" id="en-CEV-26868">Paul Defends His Work for Christ</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text 2Cor-10-1"><span class="chapternum">10 </span>Do you think I am a coward when I am with you and brave when I am far away? Well, I ask you to listen, because Christ himself was humble and gentle. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-10-2" id="en-CEV-26869"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Some people have said we act like the people of this world. So when I arrive, I expect I will have to be firm and forceful in what I say to them. Please don't make me treat you that way. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-10-3" id="en-CEV-26870"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>We live in this world, but we don't act like its people </span> <span class="text 2Cor-10-4" id="en-CEV-26871"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>or fight our battles with the weapons of this world. Instead, we use God's power that can destroy fortresses. We destroy arguments </span> <span class="text 2Cor-10-5" id="en-CEV-26872"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>and every bit of pride that keeps anyone from knowing God. We capture people's thoughts and make them obey Christ. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-10-6" id="en-CEV-26873"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>And when you completely obey him, we will punish anyone who refuses to obey.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-10-7" id="en-CEV-26874"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>You judge by appearances.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-26874a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-26874a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-26874a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> If any of you think you are the only ones who belong to Christ, then think again. We belong to Christ as much as you do. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-10-8" id="en-CEV-26875"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Maybe I brag a little too much about the authority that the Lord gave me to help you and not to hurt you. Yet I am not embarrassed to brag. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-10-9" id="en-CEV-26876"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>And I am not trying to scare you with my letters. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-10-10" id="en-CEV-26877"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Some of you are saying, “Paul's letters are harsh and powerful. But in person, he is a weakling and has nothing worth saying.” </span> <span class="text 2Cor-10-11" id="en-CEV-26878"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Those people had better understand that when I am with you, I will do exactly what I say in my letters.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-10-12" id="en-CEV-26879"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>We won't dare compare ourselves with those who think so much of themselves. But they are foolish to compare themselves with themselves. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-10-13" id="en-CEV-26880"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>We won't brag about something we don't have a right to brag about. We will only brag about the work God has sent us to do, and you are part of that work. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-10-14" id="en-CEV-26881"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>We are not bragging more than we should. After all, we did bring the message about Christ to you.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-10-15" id="en-CEV-26882"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>We don't brag about what others have done, as if we had done those things ourselves. But I hope as you become stronger in your faith, we will be able to reach many more of the people around you.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-26882b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-26882b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-26882b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> That has always been our goal. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-10-16" id="en-CEV-26883"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Then we will be able to preach the good news in other lands where we cannot take credit for work someone else has already done. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-10-17" id="en-CEV-26884"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup> The Scriptures say, “If you want to brag, then brag about the Lord.” </span> <span class="text 2Cor-10-18" id="en-CEV-26885"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>You may brag about yourself, but the only approval that counts is the Lord's approval.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
