<h3><span class="text 2Cor-12-1" id="en-CEV-26919">Visions from the Lord</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text 2Cor-12-1"><span class="chapternum">12 </span>I have to brag. There is nothing to be gained by it, but I must brag about the visions and other things that the Lord has shown me. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-12-2" id="en-CEV-26920"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>I know about one of Christ's followers who was taken up into the third heaven 14 years ago. I don't know if the man was still in his body when it happened, but God certainly knows.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-12-3" id="en-CEV-26921"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>As I said, only God really knows if this man was in his body at the time. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-12-4" id="en-CEV-26922"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>But he was taken up into paradise,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-26922a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-26922a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-26922a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> where he heard things too wonderful to tell. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-12-5" id="en-CEV-26923"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>I will brag about that man, but not about myself, except to say how weak I am.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-12-6" id="en-CEV-26924"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Yet even if I did brag, I would not be foolish. I would simply be speaking the truth. But I will try not to say too much. That way, none of you will think more highly of me than you should because of what you have seen me do and say. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-12-7" id="en-CEV-26925"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Of course, I am now referring to the wonderful things I saw. One of Satan's angels was sent to make me suffer terribly, so that I would not feel too proud.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-26925b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-26925b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-26925b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-12-8" id="en-CEV-26926"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Three times I begged the Lord to make this suffering go away. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-12-9" id="en-CEV-26927"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>But he replied, “My gift of undeserved grace is all you need. My power is strongest when you are weak.” So if Christ keeps giving me his power, I will gladly brag about how weak I am. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-12-10" id="en-CEV-26928"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Yes, I am glad to be weak or insulted or mistreated or to have troubles and sufferings, if it is for Christ. Because when I am weak, I am strong.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 2Cor-12-11" id="en-CEV-26929">Paul's Concern for the Lord's Followers at Corinth</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Cor-12-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>I have been making a fool of myself. But you forced me to do it, when you should have been speaking up for me. I may be nothing at all, but I am as good as those super apostles. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-12-12" id="en-CEV-26930"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>When I was with you, I was patient and worked all the powerful miracles and signs and wonders of a true apostle. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-12-13" id="en-CEV-26931"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>You missed out on only one blessing the other churches received. That is, you didn't have to support me. Forgive me for doing you wrong.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-12-14" id="en-CEV-26932"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>I am planning to visit you for the third time. But I still won't make a burden of myself. What I really want is you, and not what you have. Children are not supposed to save up for their parents, but parents are supposed to take care of their children. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-12-15" id="en-CEV-26933"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>So I will gladly give all I have and all I am. Will you love me less for loving you too much? </span> <span class="text 2Cor-12-16" id="en-CEV-26934"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>You agree that I wasn't a burden to you. Maybe that's because I was trying to catch you off guard and trick you. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-12-17" id="en-CEV-26935"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Were you cheated by any of those I sent to you? </span> <span class="text 2Cor-12-18" id="en-CEV-26936"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>I urged Titus to visit you, and I sent another follower with him. But Titus didn't cheat you, and we felt and behaved the same way he did.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-12-19" id="en-CEV-26937"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you? Actually, we have been speaking to God as followers of Christ. But, my friends, we did it all for your good.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-12-20" id="en-CEV-26938"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>I am afraid when I come, we won't be pleased with each other. I fear that some of you may be arguing or jealous or angry or selfish or gossiping or insulting each other. I even fear that you may be proud and acting like a mob. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-12-21" id="en-CEV-26939"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>I am afraid God will make me ashamed when I visit you again. I will feel like crying because many of you have never given up your old sins. You are still doing things that are immoral, indecent, and shameful.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
