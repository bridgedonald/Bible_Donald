So we should stay away from everything that keeps our bodies and spirits from being clean. We should honor God and try to be completely like him.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 2Cor-7-2" id="en-CEV-26814">The Church Makes Paul Happy</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Cor-7-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Make a place for us in your hearts! We haven't mistreated or hurt anyone. We haven't cheated anyone. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-7-3" id="en-CEV-26815"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>I am not saying this to be hard on you. But, as I have said before, you will always be in our thoughts, whether we live or die. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-7-4" id="en-CEV-26816"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>I trust you completely.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-26816a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-26816a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-26816a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> I am always proud of you, and I am greatly encouraged. In all my trouble I am still very happy.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-7-5" id="en-CEV-26817"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup> After we came to Macedonia, we didn't have any chance to rest. We were faced with all kinds of problems. We were troubled by enemies and troubled by fears. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-7-6" id="en-CEV-26818"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>But God cheers up people in need, and this is what he did when he sent Titus to us. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-7-7" id="en-CEV-26819"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Of course, we were glad to see Titus, but what really made us glad is the way you cheered him up. He told how sorry you were and how concerned you were about me. And this made me even happier.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-7-8" id="en-CEV-26820"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>I don't feel bad anymore, even though my letter<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-26820b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-26820b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-26820b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> hurt your feelings. I did feel bad at first, but I don't now. I know that the letter hurt you for a while. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-7-9" id="en-CEV-26821"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Now I am happy, but not because I hurt your feelings. It is because God used your hurt feelings to make you turn back to him, and none of you were harmed by us. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-7-10" id="en-CEV-26822"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>When God makes you feel sorry enough to turn to him and be saved, you don't have anything to feel bad about. But when this world makes you feel sorry, it can cause your death.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-7-11" id="en-CEV-26823"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Just look what God has done by making you feel sorry! You sincerely want to prove you are innocent. You are angry. You are shocked. You are eager to see that justice is done. You have proved that you were completely right in this matter. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-7-12" id="en-CEV-26824"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>When I wrote you, it wasn't to accuse the one who was wrong or to take up for the one who was hurt. I wrote, so God would show you how much you do care for us. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-7-13" id="en-CEV-26825"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>And we were greatly encouraged.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Cor-7-13">Although we were encouraged, we felt even better when we saw how happy Titus was, because you had shown he had nothing to worry about. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-7-14" id="en-CEV-26826"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>We had told him how much we thought of you, and you did not disappoint us.
