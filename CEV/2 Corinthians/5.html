<p class="chapter-1"><span class="text 2Cor-5-1" id="en-CEV-26774"><span class="chapternum">5 </span> Our bodies are like tents that we live in here on earth. But when these tents are destroyed, we know that God will give each of us a place to live. These homes will not be buildings someone has made, but they are in heaven and will last forever. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-5-2" id="en-CEV-26775"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>While we are here on earth, we sigh because we want to live in that heavenly home. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-5-3" id="en-CEV-26776"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>We want to put it on like clothes and not be naked.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-5-4" id="en-CEV-26777"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>These tents we now live in are like a heavy burden, and we groan. But we don't do this just because we want to leave these bodies that will die. It is because we want to change them for bodies that will never die. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-5-5" id="en-CEV-26778"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>God is the one who makes all this possible. He has given us his Spirit to make us certain he will do it. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-5-6" id="en-CEV-26779"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>So always be cheerful!</span></p><p><span class="text 2Cor-5-6">As long as we are in these bodies, we are away from the Lord. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-5-7" id="en-CEV-26780"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>But we live by faith, not by what we see. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-5-8" id="en-CEV-26781"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>We should be cheerful, because we would rather leave these bodies and be at home with the Lord. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-5-9" id="en-CEV-26782"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>But whether we are at home with the Lord or away from him, we still try our best to please him. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-5-10" id="en-CEV-26783"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup> After all, Christ will judge each of us for the good or the bad that we do while living in these bodies.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 2Cor-5-11" id="en-CEV-26784">Bringing People to God</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Cor-5-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>We know what it means to respect the Lord, and we encourage everyone to turn to him. God himself knows what we are like, and I hope you also know what kind of people we are. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-5-12" id="en-CEV-26785"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>We are not trying once more to brag about ourselves. But we want you to be proud of us, when you are with those who are not sincere and brag about what others think of them.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-5-13" id="en-CEV-26786"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>If we seem out of our minds, it is between God and us. But if we are in our right minds, it is for your good. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-5-14" id="en-CEV-26787"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>We are ruled by Christ's love for us. We are certain that if one person died for everyone else, then all of us have died. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-5-15" id="en-CEV-26788"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>And Christ did die for all of us. He died so we would no longer live for ourselves, but for the one who died and was raised to life for us.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-5-16" id="en-CEV-26789"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>We are careful not to judge people by what they seem to be, though we once judged Christ in this way. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-5-17" id="en-CEV-26790"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Anyone who belongs to Christ is a new person. The past is forgotten, and everything is new. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-5-18" id="en-CEV-26791"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>God has done it all! He sent Christ to make peace between himself and us, and he has given us the work of making peace between himself and others.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-5-19" id="en-CEV-26792"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>What we mean is that God was in Christ, offering peace and forgiveness to the people of this world. And he has given us the work of sharing his message about peace. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-5-20" id="en-CEV-26793"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>We were sent to speak for Christ, and God is begging you to listen to our message.

But God treated him as a sinner, so Christ could make us acceptable to God.</span></p>  <!--end of crossrefs-->
