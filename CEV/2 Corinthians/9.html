<h3><span class="text 2Cor-9-1" id="en-CEV-26853">The Money for God's People</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text 2Cor-9-1"><span class="chapternum">9 </span>I don't need to write you about the money you plan to give for God's people. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-9-2" id="en-CEV-26854"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>I know how eager you are to give. And I have proudly told the Lord's followers in Macedonia that you people in Achaia have been ready for a whole year. Now your desire to give has made them want to give. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-9-3" id="en-CEV-26855"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>This is why I am sending Titus and the two others to you. I want you to be ready, just as I promised. This will prove we were not wrong to brag about you.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-9-4" id="en-CEV-26856"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Some followers from Macedonia may come with me, and I want them to find that you have the money ready. If you don't, I would be embarrassed for trusting you to do this. But you would be embarrassed even more. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-9-5" id="en-CEV-26857"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>So I have decided to ask Titus and the others to spend some time with you before I arrive. This way they can arrange to collect the money you have promised. Then you will have the chance to give because you want to, and not because you feel forced to.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-9-6" id="en-CEV-26858"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Remember this saying,</span></p><div class="poetry"><p class="line"><span class="text 2Cor-9-6">“A few seeds make</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text 2Cor-9-6">a small harvest,</span></span><br/><span class="text 2Cor-9-6">but a lot of seeds make</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text 2Cor-9-6">a big harvest.”</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1"><span class="text 2Cor-9-7" id="en-CEV-26859"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup> Each of you must make up your own mind about how much to give. But don't feel sorry that you must give and don't feel you are forced to give. God loves people who love to give. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-9-8" id="en-CEV-26860"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>God can bless you with everything you need, and you will always have more than enough to do all kinds of good things for others. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-9-9" id="en-CEV-26861"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup> The Scriptures say,</span></p><div class="poetry"><p class="line"><span class="text 2Cor-9-9">“God freely gives his gifts</span><br/><span class="text 2Cor-9-9">to the poor,</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text 2Cor-9-9">and always does right.”</span></span></p></div> <top1></top1> <p class="first-line-none"><span class="text 2Cor-9-10" id="en-CEV-26862"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup> God gives seed to farmers and provides everyone with food. He will increase what you have, so you can give even more to those in need. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-9-11" id="en-CEV-26863"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>You will be blessed in every way, and you will be able to keep on being generous. Then many people will thank God when we deliver your gift.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-9-12" id="en-CEV-26864"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>What you are doing is much more than a service that supplies God's people with what they need. It is something that will make many others thank God. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-9-13" id="en-CEV-26865"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>The way in which you have proved yourselves by this service will bring honor and praise to God. You believed the message about Christ, and you obeyed it by sharing generously with God's people and with everyone else. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-9-14" id="en-CEV-26866"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Now they are praying for you and want to see you, because God used you to bless them so very much. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-9-15" id="en-CEV-26867"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Thank God for his gift that is too wonderful for words!</span></p>  <!--end of crossrefs-->
