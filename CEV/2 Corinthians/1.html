And because we are comforted, you will also be comforted, as you patiently endure suffering like ours. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-1-7" id="en-CEV-26705"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>You never disappoint us.

We have always lived honestly and sincerely, especially when we were with you. And we were guided by God's gift of undeserved grace instead of by the wisdom of this world. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-1-13" id="en-CEV-26711"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>I am not writing anything you cannot read and understand. I hope you will understand it completely, </span> <span class="text 2Cor-1-14" id="en-CEV-26712"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>just as you already partly understand us.
