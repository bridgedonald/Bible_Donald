They gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us, just as God wanted them to do.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-8-6" id="en-CEV-26834"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Titus was the one who got you started doing this good thing, so we begged him to help you finish what you had begun. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-8-7" id="en-CEV-26835"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>You do everything better than anyone else. You have stronger faith. You speak better and know more.

I am simply testing how real your love is by comparing it with the concern that others have shown. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-8-9" id="en-CEV-26837"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>You know our Lord Jesus Christ treated us with undeserved grace by giving up all his riches, so you could become rich.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-8-10" id="en-CEV-26838"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>A year ago you were the first ones to give, and you gave because you wanted to. So listen to my advice. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-8-11" id="en-CEV-26839"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>I think you should finish what you started. If you give according to what you have, you will prove you are as eager to give as you were to think about giving. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-8-12" id="en-CEV-26840"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>It doesn't matter how much you have. What matters is how much you are willing to give from what you have.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-8-13" id="en-CEV-26841"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>I am not trying to make life easier for others by making life harder for you. But it is only fair </span> <span class="text 2Cor-8-14" id="en-CEV-26842"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>for you to share with them when you have so much, and they have so little. Later, when they have more than enough, and you are in need, they can share with you. Then everyone will have a fair share, </span> <span class="text 2Cor-8-15" id="en-CEV-26843"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup> just as the Scriptures say,</span></p><div class="poetry"><p class="line"><span class="text 2Cor-8-15">“Those who gathered</span><br/><span class="text 2Cor-8-15">too much</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text 2Cor-8-15">had nothing left.</span></span><br/><span class="text 2Cor-8-15">Those who gathered</span><br/><span class="text 2Cor-8-15">only a little</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text 2Cor-8-15">had all they needed.”</span></span></p></div> <h3><span class="text 2Cor-8-16" id="en-CEV-26844">Titus and His Friends</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Cor-8-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>I am grateful that God made Titus care as much about you as we do. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-8-17" id="en-CEV-26845"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>When we begged Titus to visit you, he said he would.
