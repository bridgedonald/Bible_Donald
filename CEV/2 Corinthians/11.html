<h3><span class="text 2Cor-11-1" id="en-CEV-26886">Paul and the False Apostles</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text 2Cor-11-1"><span class="chapternum">11 </span>Please put up with a little of my foolishness. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-11-2" id="en-CEV-26887"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>I am as concerned about you as God is. You were like a virgin bride I had chosen only for Christ. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-11-3" id="en-CEV-26888"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup> But now I fear that you will be tricked, just as Eve was tricked by that lying snake. I am afraid that you might stop thinking about Christ in an honest and sincere way. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-11-4" id="en-CEV-26889"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>We told you about Jesus, and you received the Holy Spirit and accepted our message. But you let some people tell you about another Jesus. Now you are ready to receive another spirit and accept a different message. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-11-5" id="en-CEV-26890"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>I think I am as good as any of those super apostles. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-11-6" id="en-CEV-26891"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>I may not speak as well as they do, but I know as much. And this has already been made perfectly clear to you.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-11-7" id="en-CEV-26892"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Was it wrong for me to lower myself and honor you by preaching God's message free of charge? </span> <span class="text 2Cor-11-8" id="en-CEV-26893"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>I robbed other churches by taking money from them to serve you. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-11-9" id="en-CEV-26894"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup> Even when I was in need, I still didn't bother you. In fact, some of the Lord's followers from Macedonia brought me what I needed. I have not been a burden to you in the past, and I will never be a burden. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-11-10" id="en-CEV-26895"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>As surely as I speak the truth about Christ, no one in Achaia can stop me from bragging about this. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-11-11" id="en-CEV-26896"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>And it isn't because I don't love you. God himself knows how much I do love you.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-11-12" id="en-CEV-26897"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>I plan to go on doing just what I have always done. Then those people won't be able to brag about doing the same things we are doing. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-11-13" id="en-CEV-26898"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Anyway, they are no more than false apostles and dishonest workers. They only pretend to be apostles of Christ. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-11-14" id="en-CEV-26899"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>And it is no wonder. Even Satan tries to make himself look like an angel of light. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-11-15" id="en-CEV-26900"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>So why does it seem strange for Satan's servants to pretend to do what is right? Someday they will get exactly what they deserve.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 2Cor-11-16" id="en-CEV-26901">Paul's Sufferings for Christ</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Cor-11-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>I don't want any of you to think I am a fool. But if you do, then let me be a fool and brag a little. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-11-17" id="en-CEV-26902"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>When I do all this bragging, I do it as a fool and not for the Lord. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-11-18" id="en-CEV-26903"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Yet if others want to brag about what they have done, so will I. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-11-19" id="en-CEV-26904"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>And since you are so smart, you will gladly put up with a fool. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-11-20" id="en-CEV-26905"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>In fact, you let people make slaves of you and cheat you and steal from you. Why, you even let them strut around and slap you in the face. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-11-21" id="en-CEV-26906"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>I am ashamed to say we are too weak to behave in such a way.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Cor-11-21">If they can brag, so can I, but it is a foolish thing to do. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-11-22" id="en-CEV-26907"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Jews? So am I. Are they from the family of Abraham? Well, so am I. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-11-23" id="en-CEV-26908"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup> Are they servants of Christ? I am a fool to talk this way, but I serve him better than they do. I have worked harder and have been put in jail more times. I have been beaten with whips more and have been in danger of death more often.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-11-24" id="en-CEV-26909"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup> Five times my own people gave me 39 lashes with a whip. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-11-25" id="en-CEV-26910"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup> Three times the Romans beat me with a big stick, and once my enemies stoned me. I have been shipwrecked three times, and I even had to spend a night and a day in the sea. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-11-26" id="en-CEV-26911"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup> During my many travels, I have been in danger from rivers, robbers, my own people, and foreigners. My life has been in danger in cities, in deserts, at sea, and with people who only pretended to be the Lord's followers.</span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-11-27" id="en-CEV-26912"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>I have worked and struggled and spent many sleepless nights. I have gone hungry and thirsty and often had nothing to eat. I have been cold from not having enough clothes to keep me warm. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-11-28" id="en-CEV-26913"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>Besides everything else, each day I am burdened down, worrying about all the churches. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-11-29" id="en-CEV-26914"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>When others are weak, I am weak too. When others are tricked into sin, I get angry.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-26914a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-26914a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-26914a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class="text 2Cor-11-30" id="en-CEV-26915"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>If I have to brag, I will brag about how weak I am. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-11-31" id="en-CEV-26916"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>God, the Father of our Lord Jesus, knows I am not lying. And God is to be praised forever! </span> <span class="text 2Cor-11-32" id="en-CEV-26917"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup> The governor of Damascus at the time of King Aretas had the city gates guarded, so he could capture me. </span> <span class="text 2Cor-11-33" id="en-CEV-26918"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>But I escaped by being let down in a basket through a window in the city wall.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
