<h3><span class="text 1Pet-4-1" id="en-CEV-28327">Being Faithful to God</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text 1Pet-4-1"><span class="chapternum">4 </span>Christ suffered here on earth. Now you must be ready to suffer as he did, because suffering shows that you have stopped sinning. </span> <span class="text 1Pet-4-2" id="en-CEV-28328"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>It means you have turned from your own desires and want to obey God for the rest of your life. </span> <span class="text 1Pet-4-3" id="en-CEV-28329"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>You have already lived long enough like people who don't know God. You were immoral and followed your evil desires. You went around drinking and partying and carrying on. In fact, you even worshiped disgusting idols. </span> <span class="text 1Pet-4-4" id="en-CEV-28330"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Now your former friends wonder why you have stopped running around with them, and they curse you for it. </span> <span class="text 1Pet-4-5" id="en-CEV-28331"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>But they will have to answer to God, who judges the living and the dead. </span> <span class="text 1Pet-4-6" id="en-CEV-28332"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>The good news has even been preached to the dead,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28332a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28332a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28332a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> so that after they have been judged for what they have done in this life, their spirits will live with God.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Pet-4-7" id="en-CEV-28333"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Everything will soon come to an end. So be serious and be sensible enough to pray.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Pet-4-8" id="en-CEV-28334"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup> Most important of all, you must sincerely love each other, because love wipes away many sins.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Pet-4-9" id="en-CEV-28335"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Welcome people into your home and don't grumble about it.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Pet-4-10" id="en-CEV-28336"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Each of you has been blessed with one of God's many wonderful gifts to be used in the service of others. So use your gift well. </span> <span class="text 1Pet-4-11" id="en-CEV-28337"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>If you have the gift of speaking, preach God's message. If you have the gift of helping others, do it with the strength that God supplies. Everything should be done in a way that will bring honor to God because of Jesus Christ, who is glorious and powerful forever. Amen.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 1Pet-4-12" id="en-CEV-28338">Suffering for Being a Christian</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Pet-4-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Dear friends, don't be surprised or shocked that you are going through testing that is like walking through fire. </span> <span class="text 1Pet-4-13" id="en-CEV-28339"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Be glad for the chance to suffer as Christ suffered. It will prepare you for even greater happiness when he makes his glorious return.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Pet-4-14" id="en-CEV-28340"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Count it a blessing when you suffer for being a Christian. This shows that God's glorious Spirit is with you. </span> <span class="text 1Pet-4-15" id="en-CEV-28341"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>But you deserve to suffer if you are a murderer, a thief, a crook, or a busybody. </span> <span class="text 1Pet-4-16" id="en-CEV-28342"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Don't be ashamed to suffer for being a Christian. Praise God that you belong to him. </span> <span class="text 1Pet-4-17" id="en-CEV-28343"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>God has already begun judging his own people. And if his judgment begins with us, imagine how terrible it will be for those who refuse to obey his message.
