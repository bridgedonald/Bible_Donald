In this vision I saw two baskets of figs in front of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s temple. </span> <span class="text Jer-24-2" id="en-CEV-17677"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>One basket was full of very good figs that ripened early, and the other was full of rotten figs that were not fit to eat.</span></p> <p><span class="text Jer-24-3" id="en-CEV-17678"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>“Jeremiah,” the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> asked, “what do you see?”</span></p><p><span class="text Jer-24-3">“Figs,” I said. “Some are very good, but the others are too rotten to eat.”</span></p> <p><span class="text Jer-24-4" id="en-CEV-17679"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Then the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> told me to say:</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text Jer-24-5" id="en-CEV-17680"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>People of Judah, the good figs stand for those of you I sent away as exiles to Babylonia, </span> <span class="text Jer-24-6" id="en-CEV-17681"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>where I am watching over them.
