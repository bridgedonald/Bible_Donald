And now you have punished Israel with disaster. </span> <span class="text Jer-32-24" id="en-CEV-17879"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>Jerusalem is under attack, and we suffer from hunger and disease. The Babylonians have already built dirt ramps up to the walls of our city, and you can see that Jerusalem will be captured just as you said.</span></p> <p><span class="text Jer-32-25" id="en-CEV-17880"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>So why did you tell me to get some witnesses and buy a field with my silver, when Jerusalem is about to be captured by the Babylonians?</span></p> <h3><span class="text Jer-32-26" id="en-CEV-17881">The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> Explains about the Field</span></h3><p><span class="text Jer-32-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> explained:</span></p> <p><span class="text Jer-32-27" id="en-CEV-17882"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>Jeremiah, I am the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God.

The people of Jerusalem have made me angry by going up to the flat roofs of their houses and burning incense to Baal and offering wine sacrifices to other gods. Now these houses will be burned to the ground!</span></p> <p><span class="text Jer-32-30-Jer-32-33" id="en-CEV-17885"><sup class="versenum">30-33 </sup>The kings and the officials, the priests and the prophets, and everyone else in Israel and Judah have turned from me and made me angry by worshiping idols. Again and again I have tried to teach my people to obey me, but they refuse to be corrected.</span></p><p><span class="text Jer-32-30-Jer-32-33">I am going to get rid of Jerusalem, because its people have done nothing but evil. </span> <span class="text Jer-32-34" id="en-CEV-17886"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup> They have set up repulsive idols in my temple, and now it isn't a fit place to worship me. </span> <span class="text Jer-32-35" id="en-CEV-17887"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup> And they led Judah into sin by building places to worship Baal in Hinnom Valley, where they also sacrificed their sons and daughters to the god Molech. I have never even imagined they would commit such disgusting sins.</span></p> <p><span class="text Jer-32-36" id="en-CEV-17888"><sup class="versenum">36 </sup>Jeremiah, what you said is true. The people of Jerusalem are suffering from hunger and disease, and so the king of Babylonia will be able to capture Jerusalem.</span></p> <p><span class="text Jer-32-37" id="en-CEV-17889"><sup class="versenum">37 </sup>I am angry with the people of Jerusalem, and I will scatter them in foreign countries.

Then they will realize that, for their own good and the good of their children, they must worship only me. They will even be afraid to turn away from me. I will make an agreement with them that will never end, and I won't ever stop doing good things for them. With all my heart I promise that they will be planted in this land once again. </span> <span class="text Jer-32-42" id="en-CEV-17892"><sup class="versenum">42 </sup>Even though I have brought disaster on the people, I will someday do all these good things for them.</span></p> <p><span class="text Jer-32-43" id="en-CEV-17893"><sup class="versenum">43 </sup>Jeremiah, when you bought the field, you showed that fields will someday be bought and sold again. You say that this land has been conquered by the Babylonians and has become a desert, emptied of people and animals. </span> <span class="text Jer-32-44" id="en-CEV-17894"><sup class="versenum">44 </sup>But someday, people will again spend their silver to buy fields everywhere—in the territory of Benjamin, the region around Jerusalem and the towns of Judah, and in the hill country, the foothills to the west, and the Southern Desert. Buyers and sellers and witnesses will sign and seal the bills of sale for the fields. It will happen, because I will give this land back to my people. I, the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, have spoken.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
