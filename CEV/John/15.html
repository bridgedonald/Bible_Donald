But he trims clean every branch that does produce fruit, so that it will produce even more fruit. </span> <span class="text John-15-3" id="en-CEV-24631"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>You are already clean because of what I have said to you.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text John-15-4" id="en-CEV-24632"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Stay joined to me, and I will stay joined to you. Just as a branch cannot produce fruit unless it stays joined to the vine, you cannot produce fruit unless you stay joined to me. </span> <span class="text John-15-5" id="en-CEV-24633"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>I am the vine, and you are the branches. If you stay joined to me, and I stay joined to you, then you will produce lots of fruit. But you cannot do anything without me. </span> <span class="text John-15-6" id="en-CEV-24634"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>If you don't stay joined to me, you will be thrown away. You will be like dry branches that are gathered up and burned in a fire.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text John-15-7" id="en-CEV-24635"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Stay joined to me and let my teachings become part of you. Then you can pray for whatever you want, and your prayer will be answered. </span> <span class="text John-15-8" id="en-CEV-24636"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>When you become fruitful disciples of mine, my Father will be honored. </span> <span class="text John-15-9" id="en-CEV-24637"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>I have loved you, just as my Father has loved me. So remain faithful to my love for you. </span> <span class="text John-15-10" id="en-CEV-24638"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>If you obey me, I will keep loving you, just as my Father keeps loving me, because I have obeyed him.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text John-15-11" id="en-CEV-24639"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>I have told you this to make you as completely happy as I am. </span> <span class="text John-15-12" id="en-CEV-24640"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup> Now I tell you to love each other, as I have loved you. </span> <span class="text John-15-13" id="en-CEV-24641"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>The greatest way to show love for friends is to die for them. </span> <span class="text John-15-14" id="en-CEV-24642"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>And you are my friends, if you obey me. </span> <span class="text John-15-15" id="en-CEV-24643"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Servants don't know what their master is doing, and so I don't speak to you as my servants. I speak to you as my friends, and I have told you everything my Father has told me.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text John-15-16" id="en-CEV-24644"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>You did not choose me. I chose you and sent you out to produce fruit, the kind of fruit that will last.

But you don't belong to the world. I have chosen you to leave the world behind, and this is why its people hate you. </span> <span class="text John-15-20" id="en-CEV-24648"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup> Remember how I told you that servants are not greater than their master. So if people mistreat me, they will mistreat you.
