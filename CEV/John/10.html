<h3><span class="text John-10-1" id="en-CEV-24414">A Story about Sheep</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text John-10-1"><span class="chapternum">10 </span>Jesus said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text John-10-1">I tell you for certain only thieves and robbers climb over the fence instead of going in through the gate to the sheep pen. </span> <span class="text John-10-2-John-10-3" id="en-CEV-24415"><sup class="versenum">2-3 </sup>But the gatekeeper opens the gate for the shepherd, and he goes in through it. The sheep know their shepherd's voice. He calls each of them by name and leads them out.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text John-10-4" id="en-CEV-24416"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>When he has led out all of his sheep, he walks in front of them, and they follow, because they know his voice. </span> <span class="text John-10-5" id="en-CEV-24417"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>The sheep will not follow strangers. They don't recognize a stranger's voice, and they run away.</span></p> <p><span class="text John-10-6" id="en-CEV-24418"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Jesus told the people this story. But they did not understand what he was talking about.</span></p> <h3><span class="text John-10-7" id="en-CEV-24419">Jesus Is the Good Shepherd</span></h3><p><span class="text John-10-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Jesus said:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text John-10-7">I tell you for certain that I am the gate for the sheep. </span> <span class="text John-10-8" id="en-CEV-24420"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Everyone who came before me was a thief or a robber, and the sheep did not listen to any of them. </span> <span class="text John-10-9" id="en-CEV-24421"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>I am the gate. All who come in through me will be saved. Through me they will come and go and find pasture.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text John-10-10" id="en-CEV-24422"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>A thief comes only to rob, kill, and destroy. I came so everyone would have life, and have it fully. </span> <span class="text John-10-11" id="en-CEV-24423"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup> I am the good shepherd, and the good shepherd gives up his life for his sheep. </span> <span class="text John-10-12" id="en-CEV-24424"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Hired workers are not like the shepherd. They don't own the sheep, and when they see a wolf coming, they run off and leave the sheep. Then the wolf attacks and scatters the flock. </span> <span class="text John-10-13" id="en-CEV-24425"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Hired workers run away because they don't care about the sheep.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text John-10-14" id="en-CEV-24426"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup> I am the good shepherd. I know my sheep, and they know me. </span> <span class="text John-10-15" id="en-CEV-24427"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup> Just as the Father knows me, I know the Father, and I give up my life for my sheep. </span> <span class="text John-10-16" id="en-CEV-24428"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>I have other sheep that are not in this sheep pen. I must also bring them together, when they hear my voice. Then there will be one flock of sheep and one shepherd.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text John-10-17" id="en-CEV-24429"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>The Father loves me, because I give up my life, so I may receive it back again. </span> <span class="text John-10-18" id="en-CEV-24430"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>No one takes my life from me. I give it up willingly! I have the power to give it up and the power to receive it back again, just as my Father commanded me to do.</span></p> <p><span class="text John-10-19" id="en-CEV-24431"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>The people took sides because of what Jesus had told them. </span> <span class="text John-10-20" id="en-CEV-24432"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Many of them said, “He has a demon in him! He is crazy! Why listen to him?”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-10-21" id="en-CEV-24433"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>But others said, “How could anyone with a demon in him say these things? No one like this could give sight to a blind person!”</span></p> <h3><span class="text John-10-22" id="en-CEV-24434">Jesus Is Rejected</span></h3><p><span class="text John-10-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup> That winter, Jesus was in Jerusalem for the Temple Festival. </span> <span class="text John-10-23" id="en-CEV-24435"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>One day he was walking in the part of the temple known as Solomon's Porch,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-24435a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-24435a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-24435a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> </span> <span class="text John-10-24" id="en-CEV-24436"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>and the people gathered all around him. They said, “How long are you going to keep us guessing? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly!”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-10-25" id="en-CEV-24437"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Jesus answered:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text John-10-25">I have told you, and you refused to believe me. The things I do by my Father's authority show who I am. </span> <span class="text John-10-26" id="en-CEV-24438"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>But since you are not my sheep, you don't believe me. </span> <span class="text John-10-27" id="en-CEV-24439"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>My sheep know my voice, and I know them. They follow me, </span> <span class="text John-10-28" id="en-CEV-24440"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>and I give them eternal life, so that they will never be lost. No one can snatch them out of my hand. </span> <span class="text John-10-29" id="en-CEV-24441"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup> My Father gave them to me, and he is greater than all others.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-24441b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-24441b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-24441b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> No one can snatch them from his hands, </span> <span class="text John-10-30" id="en-CEV-24442"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>and I am one with the Father.</span></p> <p><span class="text John-10-31" id="en-CEV-24443"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>Once again the people picked up stones in order to kill Jesus. </span> <span class="text John-10-32" id="en-CEV-24444"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>But he said, “I have shown you many good things my Father sent me to do. Which one are you going to stone me for?”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-10-33" id="en-CEV-24445"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>They answered, “We are not stoning you because of any good thing you did. We are stoning you because you did a terrible thing. You are just a man, and here you are claiming to be God!”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-10-34" id="en-CEV-24446"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup> Jesus replied:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text John-10-34">In your Scriptures doesn't God say, “You are gods”? </span> <span class="text John-10-35" id="en-CEV-24447"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>You can't argue with the Scriptures, and God spoke to those people and called them gods. </span> <span class="text John-10-36" id="en-CEV-24448"><sup class="versenum">36 </sup>So why do you accuse me of a terrible sin for saying that I am the Son of God? After all, it is the Father who prepared me for this work. He is also the one who sent me into the world. </span> <span class="text John-10-37" id="en-CEV-24449"><sup class="versenum">37 </sup>If I don't do as my Father does, you should not believe me. </span> <span class="text John-10-38" id="en-CEV-24450"><sup class="versenum">38 </sup>But if I do what my Father does, you should believe because of that, even if you don't have faith in me. Then you will know for certain that the Father is one with me, and I am one with the Father.</span></p> <p><span class="text John-10-39" id="en-CEV-24451"><sup class="versenum">39 </sup>Again they wanted to arrest Jesus. But he escaped </span> <span class="text John-10-40" id="en-CEV-24452"><sup class="versenum">40 </sup> and crossed the Jordan to the place where John had earlier been baptizing. While Jesus was there, </span> <span class="text John-10-41" id="en-CEV-24453"><sup class="versenum">41 </sup>many people came to him. They were saying, “John didn't work any miracles, but everything he said about Jesus is true.” </span> <span class="text John-10-42" id="en-CEV-24454"><sup class="versenum">42 </sup>A lot of those people also put their faith in Jesus.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
