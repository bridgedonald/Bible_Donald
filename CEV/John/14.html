That is all we need.”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-14-9" id="en-CEV-24606"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Jesus replied:</span></p><p class="left-1"><span class="text John-14-9">Philip, I have been with you for a long time. Don't you know who I am? If you have seen me, you have seen the Father. How can you ask me to show you the Father? </span> <span class="text John-14-10" id="en-CEV-24607"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Don't you believe that I am one with the Father and that the Father is one with me?
