They were yours, but you gave them to me, and they have obeyed you. </span> <span class="text John-17-7" id="en-CEV-24695"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>They know that you gave me everything I have. </span> <span class="text John-17-8" id="en-CEV-24696"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>I told my followers what you told me, and they accepted it. They know I came from you, and they believe you are the one who sent me. </span> <span class="text John-17-9" id="en-CEV-24697"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>I am praying for them, but not for those who belong to this world.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-24697a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-24697a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-24697a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> My followers belong to you, and I am praying for them. </span> <span class="text John-17-10" id="en-CEV-24698"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>All I have is yours, and all you have is mine, and they will bring glory to me.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text John-17-11" id="en-CEV-24699"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Holy Father, I am no longer in the world. I am coming to you, but my followers are still in the world. So keep them safe by the power of the name you have given me. Then they will be one with each other, just as you and I are one. </span> <span class="text John-17-12" id="en-CEV-24700"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup> While I was with them, I kept them safe by the power you have given me. I guarded them, and not one of them was lost, except the one who had to be lost. This happened so that what the Scriptures say would come true.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text John-17-13" id="en-CEV-24701"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>I am on my way to you. But I say these things while I am still in the world, so my followers will have the same complete joy that I do. </span> <span class="text John-17-14" id="en-CEV-24702"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>I have told them your message. But the people of this world hate them, because they don't belong to this world, just as I don't.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text John-17-15" id="en-CEV-24703"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Father, I don't ask you to take my followers out of the world, but keep them safe from the evil one. </span> <span class="text John-17-16" id="en-CEV-24704"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>They don't belong to this world, and neither do I. </span> <span class="text John-17-17" id="en-CEV-24705"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Your word is the truth. So let this truth make them completely yours. </span> <span class="text John-17-18" id="en-CEV-24706"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>I am sending them into the world, just as you sent me. </span> <span class="text John-17-19" id="en-CEV-24707"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>I have given myself completely for their sake, so they may belong completely to the truth.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text John-17-20" id="en-CEV-24708"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>I am not praying just for these followers. I am also praying for everyone else who will have faith because of what my followers will say about me. </span> <span class="text John-17-21" id="en-CEV-24709"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>I want all of them to be one with each other, just as I am one with you and you are one with me. I also want them to be one with us. Then the people of this world will believe that you sent me.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text John-17-22" id="en-CEV-24710"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>I have honored my followers in the same way you honored me, in order that they may be one with each other, just as we are one. </span> <span class="text John-17-23" id="en-CEV-24711"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>I am one with them, and you are one with me, so they may become completely one. Then this world's people will know that you sent me. They will know that you love my followers as much as you love me.</span></p> <p class="left-1"><span class="text John-17-24" id="en-CEV-24712"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>Father, I want everyone you have given me to be with me, wherever I am. Then they will see the glory you have given me, because you loved me before the world was created. </span> <span class="text John-17-25" id="en-CEV-24713"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Good Father, the people of this world don't know you. But I know you, and my followers know that you sent me. </span> <span class="text John-17-26" id="en-CEV-24714"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>I told them what you are like, and I will tell them even more. Then the love you have for me will become part of them, and I will be one with them.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
