<h3><span class="text John-9-1" id="en-CEV-24375">Jesus Heals a Man Born Blind</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text John-9-1"><span class="chapternum">9 </span>As Jesus walked along, he saw a man who had been blind since birth. </span> <span class="text John-9-2" id="en-CEV-24376"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Jesus' disciples asked, “Teacher, why was this man born blind? Was it because he or his parents sinned?”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-9-3" id="en-CEV-24377"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>“No, it wasn't!” Jesus answered. “But because of his blindness, you will see God work a miracle for him. </span> <span class="text John-9-4" id="en-CEV-24378"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>As long as it is day, we must do what the one who sent me wants me to do. When night comes, no one can work. </span> <span class="text John-9-5" id="en-CEV-24379"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup> While I am in the world, I am the light for the world.”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-9-6" id="en-CEV-24380"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>After Jesus said this, he spit on the ground. He made some mud and smeared it on the man's eyes. </span> <span class="text John-9-7" id="en-CEV-24381"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Then he said, “Go wash off the mud in Siloam Pool.” The man went and washed in Siloam, which means “One Who Is Sent.” When he had washed off the mud, he could see.</span></p> <p><span class="text John-9-8" id="en-CEV-24382"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>The man's neighbors and the people who had seen him begging wondered if he really could be the same man. </span> <span class="text John-9-9" id="en-CEV-24383"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Some of them said he was the same beggar, while others said he only looked like him. But he told them, “I am that man.”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-9-10" id="en-CEV-24384"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>“Then how can you see?” they asked.</span></p> <p><span class="text John-9-11" id="en-CEV-24385"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>He answered, “Someone named Jesus made some mud and smeared it on my eyes. He told me to go and wash it off in Siloam Pool. When I did, I could see.”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-9-12" id="en-CEV-24386"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>“Where is he now?” they asked.</span></p><p><span class="text John-9-12">“I don't know,” he answered.</span></p> <h3><span class="text John-9-13-John-9-14" id="en-CEV-24387">The Pharisees Try To Find Out What Happened</span></h3><p><span class="text John-9-13-John-9-14"><sup class="versenum">13-14 </sup>The day when Jesus made the mud and healed the man was a Sabbath. So the people took the man to the Pharisees. </span> <span class="text John-9-15" id="en-CEV-24388"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>They asked him how he was able to see, and he answered, “Jesus made some mud and smeared it on my eyes. Then after I washed it off, I could see.”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-9-16" id="en-CEV-24389"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Some of the Pharisees said, “This man Jesus doesn't come from God. If he did, he would not break the law of the Sabbath.”</span></p><p><span class="text John-9-16">Others asked, “How could someone who is a sinner work such a miracle?”<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-24389a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-24389a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-24389a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></span></p><p><span class="text John-9-16">Since the Pharisees could not agree among themselves, </span> <span class="text John-9-17" id="en-CEV-24390"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>they asked the man, “What do you say about this one who healed your eyes?”</span></p><p><span class="text John-9-17">“He is a prophet!” the man told them.</span></p> <p><span class="text John-9-18" id="en-CEV-24391"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>But the Jewish leaders would not believe that the man had once been blind. They sent for his parents </span> <span class="text John-9-19" id="en-CEV-24392"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>and asked them, “Is this the son that you said was born blind? How can he now see?”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-9-20" id="en-CEV-24393"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>The man's parents answered, “We are certain that he is our son, and we know that he was born blind. </span> <span class="text John-9-21" id="en-CEV-24394"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>But we don't know how he got his sight or who gave it to him. Ask him! He is old enough to speak for himself.”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-9-22-John-9-23" id="en-CEV-24395"><sup class="versenum">22-23 </sup>The man's parents said this because they were afraid of their leaders. The leaders had already agreed that no one was to have anything to do with anyone who said Jesus was the Messiah.</span></p> <p><span class="text John-9-24" id="en-CEV-24396"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>The leaders called the man back and said, “Swear by God to tell the truth! We know that Jesus is a sinner.”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-9-25" id="en-CEV-24397"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>The man replied, “I don't know if he is a sinner or not. All I know is that I used to be blind, but now I can see!”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-9-26" id="en-CEV-24398"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>“What did he do to you?” they asked. “How did he heal your eyes?”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-9-27" id="en-CEV-24399"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>The man answered, “I have already told you once, and you refused to listen. Why do you want me to tell you again? Do you also want to become his disciples?”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-9-28" id="en-CEV-24400"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>The leaders insulted the man and said, “You are his follower! We are followers of Moses. </span> <span class="text John-9-29" id="en-CEV-24401"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>We are sure God spoke to Moses, but we don't even know where Jesus comes from.”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-9-30" id="en-CEV-24402"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>“How strange!” the man replied. “He healed my eyes, and yet you don't know where he comes from. </span> <span class="text John-9-31" id="en-CEV-24403"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>We know that God listens only to people who love and obey him. God doesn't listen to sinners. </span> <span class="text John-9-32" id="en-CEV-24404"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>And this is the first time in history anyone has ever given sight to someone born blind. </span> <span class="text John-9-33" id="en-CEV-24405"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>Jesus could not do anything unless he came from God.”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-9-34" id="en-CEV-24406"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>The leaders told the man, “You have been a sinner since the day you were born! Do you think you can teach us anything?” Then they said, “You can never come back into any of our synagogues!”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-9-35" id="en-CEV-24407"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>When Jesus heard what had happened, he went and found the man. Then Jesus asked, “Do you have faith in the Son of Man?”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-9-36" id="en-CEV-24408"><sup class="versenum">36 </sup>He replied, “Sir, if you will tell me who he is, I will put my faith in him.”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-9-37" id="en-CEV-24409"><sup class="versenum">37 </sup>“You have already seen him,” Jesus answered, “and right now he is talking with you.”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-9-38" id="en-CEV-24410"><sup class="versenum">38 </sup>The man said, “Lord, I put my faith in you!” Then he worshiped Jesus.</span></p> <p><span class="text John-9-39" id="en-CEV-24411"><sup class="versenum">39 </sup>Jesus told him, “I came to judge the people of this world. I am here to give sight to the blind and to make blind everyone who can see.”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-9-40" id="en-CEV-24412"><sup class="versenum">40 </sup>When the Pharisees heard Jesus say this, they asked, “Are we blind?”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-9-41" id="en-CEV-24413"><sup class="versenum">41 </sup>Jesus answered, “If you were blind, you would not be guilty. But now that you claim to see, you will keep on being guilty.”</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
