<h3><span class="text John-21-1" id="en-CEV-24826">Jesus Appears to Seven Disciples</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text John-21-1"><span class="chapternum">21 </span>Jesus later appeared to his disciples along the shore of Lake Tiberias. </span> <span class="text John-21-2" id="en-CEV-24827"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Simon Peter, Thomas the Twin, Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, and the brothers James and John,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-24827a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-24827a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-24827a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> were there, together with two other disciples. </span> <span class="text John-21-3" id="en-CEV-24828"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup> Simon Peter said, “I'm going fishing!”</span></p><p><span class="text John-21-3">The others said, “We will go with you.” They went out in their boat. But they didn't catch a thing that night.</span></p> <p><span class="text John-21-4" id="en-CEV-24829"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Early the next morning Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize who he was. </span> <span class="text John-21-5" id="en-CEV-24830"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Jesus shouted, “Friends, have you caught anything?”</span></p><p><span class="text John-21-5">“No!” they answered.</span></p> <p><span class="text John-21-6" id="en-CEV-24831"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup> So he told them, “Let your net down on the right side of your boat, and you will catch some fish.”</span></p><p><span class="text John-21-6">They did, and the net was so full of fish that they could not drag it up into the boat.</span></p> <p><span class="text John-21-7" id="en-CEV-24832"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Jesus' favorite disciple told Peter, “It's the Lord!” When Simon heard it was the Lord, he put on the clothes he had taken off while he was working. Then he jumped into the water. </span> <span class="text John-21-8" id="en-CEV-24833"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>The boat was only about 100 meters from shore. So the other disciples stayed in the boat and dragged in the net full of fish.</span></p> <p><span class="text John-21-9" id="en-CEV-24834"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>When the disciples got out of the boat, they saw some bread and a charcoal fire with fish on it. </span> <span class="text John-21-10" id="en-CEV-24835"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Jesus told his disciples, “Bring some of the fish you just caught.” </span> <span class="text John-21-11" id="en-CEV-24836"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Simon Peter got back into the boat and dragged the net to shore. In it were 153 large fish, but still the net did not rip.</span></p> <p><span class="text John-21-12" id="en-CEV-24837"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Jesus said, “Come and eat!” But none of the disciples dared ask who he was. They knew he was the Lord. </span> <span class="text John-21-13" id="en-CEV-24838"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Jesus took the bread in his hands and gave some of it to his disciples. He did the same with the fish. </span> <span class="text John-21-14" id="en-CEV-24839"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>This was the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from death.</span></p> <h3><span class="text John-21-15" id="en-CEV-24840">Jesus and Peter</span></h3><p><span class="text John-21-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>When Jesus and his disciples had finished eating, he asked, “Simon son of John, do you love me more than the others do?”<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-24840b" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-24840b" title="See footnote b"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-24840b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup></span></p><p><span class="text John-21-15">Simon Peter answered, “Yes, Lord, you know I do!”</span></p><p><span class="text John-21-15">“Then feed my lambs,” Jesus said.</span></p> <p><span class="text John-21-16" id="en-CEV-24841"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Jesus asked a second time, “Simon son of John, do you love me?”</span></p><p><span class="text John-21-16">Peter answered, “Yes, Lord, you know I love you!”</span></p><p><span class="text John-21-16">“Then take care of my sheep,” Jesus told him.</span></p> <p><span class="text John-21-17" id="en-CEV-24842"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Jesus asked a third time, “Simon son of John, do you love me?”</span></p><p><span class="text John-21-17">Peter was hurt because Jesus had asked him three times if he loved him. So he told Jesus, “Lord, you know everything. You know I love you.”</span></p><p><span class="text John-21-17">Jesus replied, “Feed my sheep. </span> <span class="text John-21-18" id="en-CEV-24843"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>I tell you for certain that when you were a young man, you dressed yourself and went wherever you wanted to go. But when you are old, you will hold out your hands. Then others will wrap your belt around you and lead you where you don't want to go.”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-21-19" id="en-CEV-24844"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Jesus said this to tell how Peter would die and bring honor to God. Then he said to Peter, “Follow me!”</span></p> <h3><span class="text John-21-20" id="en-CEV-24845">Jesus and His Favorite Disciple</span></h3><p><span class="text John-21-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup> Peter turned and saw Jesus' favorite disciple following them. He was the same one who had sat next to Jesus at the meal and had asked, “Lord, who is going to betray you?” </span> <span class="text John-21-21" id="en-CEV-24846"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>When Peter saw this disciple, he asked Jesus, “Lord, what about him?”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-21-22" id="en-CEV-24847"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Jesus answered, “What is it to you, if I want him to live until I return? You must follow me.” </span> <span class="text John-21-23" id="en-CEV-24848"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>So the rumor spread among the other disciples that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say he would not die. He simply said, “What is it to you, if I want him to live until I return?”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-21-24" id="en-CEV-24849"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>This disciple is the one who told all of this. He wrote it, and we know he is telling the truth.</span></p> <p><span class="text John-21-25" id="en-CEV-24850"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Jesus did many other things. If they were all written in books, I don't suppose there would be room enough in the whole world for all the books.</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
