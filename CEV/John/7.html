Then your disciples can see what you are doing. </span> <span class="text John-7-4" id="en-CEV-24266"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>No one does anything in secret, if they want others to know about them. So let the world know what you are doing!” </span> <span class="text John-7-5" id="en-CEV-24267"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Even Jesus' own brothers had not yet become his followers.</span></p> <p><span class="text John-7-6" id="en-CEV-24268"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Jesus answered, “My time hasn't yet come,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-24268a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-24268a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-24268a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> but your time is always here. </span> <span class="text John-7-7" id="en-CEV-24269"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>The people of this world cannot hate you.

My time hasn't yet come, and I am not going.” </span> <span class="text John-7-9" id="en-CEV-24271"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Jesus said this and stayed on in Galilee.</span></p> <h3><span class="text John-7-10" id="en-CEV-24272">Jesus at the Festival of Shelters</span></h3><p><span class="text John-7-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>After Jesus' brothers had gone to the festival, he went secretly, without telling anyone.</span></p> <p><span class="text John-7-11" id="en-CEV-24273"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>During the festival the leaders of the people looked for Jesus and asked, “Where is he?” </span> <span class="text John-7-12" id="en-CEV-24274"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>The crowds even got into an argument about him.
