<h3><span class="text John-11-1-John-11-2" id="en-CEV-24455">The Death of Lazarus</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text John-11-1-John-11-2"><span class="chapternum">11 </span><sup class="versenum">1-2 </sup> A man by the name of Lazarus was sick in the village of Bethany. He had two sisters, Mary and Martha. This was the same Mary who later poured perfume on the Lord's head and wiped his feet with her hair. </span> <span class="text John-11-3" id="en-CEV-24456"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>The sisters sent a message to the Lord and told him that his good friend Lazarus was sick.</span></p> <p><span class="text John-11-4" id="en-CEV-24457"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>When Jesus heard this, he said, “His sickness won't end in death. It will bring glory to God and his Son.”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-11-5" id="en-CEV-24458"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Jesus loved Martha and her sister and brother. </span> <span class="text John-11-6" id="en-CEV-24459"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>But he stayed where he was for two more days. </span> <span class="text John-11-7" id="en-CEV-24460"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Then he said to his disciples, “Now we will go back to Judea.”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-11-8" id="en-CEV-24461"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>“Teacher,” they said, “the people there want to stone you to death! Why do you want to go back?”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-11-9" id="en-CEV-24462"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Jesus answered, “Aren't there twelve hours in each day? If you walk during the day, you will have light from the sun, and you won't stumble. </span> <span class="text John-11-10" id="en-CEV-24463"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>But if you walk during the night, you will stumble, because you don't have any light.” </span> <span class="text John-11-11" id="en-CEV-24464"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Then he told them, “Our friend Lazarus is asleep, and I am going there to wake him up.”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-11-12" id="en-CEV-24465"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>They replied, “Lord, if he is asleep, he will get better.” </span> <span class="text John-11-13" id="en-CEV-24466"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Jesus really meant that Lazarus was dead, but they thought he was talking only about sleep.</span></p> <p><span class="text John-11-14" id="en-CEV-24467"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Then Jesus told them plainly, “Lazarus is dead! </span> <span class="text John-11-15" id="en-CEV-24468"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>I am glad I wasn't there, because now you will have a chance to put your faith in me. Let's go to him.”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-11-16" id="en-CEV-24469"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Thomas, whose nickname was “Twin,” said to the other disciples, “Come on. Let's go, so we can die with him.”</span></p> <h3><span class="text John-11-17" id="en-CEV-24470">Jesus Brings Lazarus to Life</span></h3><p><span class="text John-11-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>When Jesus got to Bethany, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days. </span> <span class="text John-11-18" id="en-CEV-24471"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Bethany was less than three kilometers from Jerusalem, </span> <span class="text John-11-19" id="en-CEV-24472"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>and many people had come from the city to comfort Martha and Mary because their brother had died.</span></p> <p><span class="text John-11-20" id="en-CEV-24473"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>When Martha heard that Jesus had arrived, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed in the house. </span> <span class="text John-11-21" id="en-CEV-24474"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. </span> <span class="text John-11-22" id="en-CEV-24475"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Yet even now I know that God will do anything you ask.”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-11-23" id="en-CEV-24476"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>Jesus told her, “Your brother will live again!”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-11-24" id="en-CEV-24477"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup> Martha answered, “I know he will be raised to life on the last day,<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-24477a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-24477a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-24477a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> when all the dead are raised.”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-11-25" id="en-CEV-24478"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Jesus then said, “I am the one who raises the dead to life! Everyone who has faith in me will live, even if they die. </span> <span class="text John-11-26" id="en-CEV-24479"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>And everyone who lives because of faith in me will never really die. Do you believe this?”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-11-27" id="en-CEV-24480"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>“Yes, Lord!” she replied. “I believe you are the Christ, the Son of God. You are the one we hoped would come into the world.”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-11-28" id="en-CEV-24481"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>After Martha said this, she went and privately said to her sister Mary, “The Teacher is here, and he wants to see you.” </span> <span class="text John-11-29" id="en-CEV-24482"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>As soon as Mary heard this, she got up and went out to Jesus. </span> <span class="text John-11-30" id="en-CEV-24483"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>He was still outside the village where Martha had gone to meet him. </span> <span class="text John-11-31" id="en-CEV-24484"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>Many people had come to comfort Mary, and when they saw her quickly leave the house, they thought she was going out to the tomb to cry. So they followed her.</span></p> <p><span class="text John-11-32" id="en-CEV-24485"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>Mary went to where Jesus was. Then as soon as she saw him, she knelt at his feet and said, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-11-33" id="en-CEV-24486"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>When Jesus saw that Mary and the people with her were crying, he was terribly upset </span> <span class="text John-11-34" id="en-CEV-24487"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>and asked, “Where have you put his body?”</span></p><p><span class="text John-11-34">They replied, “Lord, come and you will see.”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-11-35" id="en-CEV-24488"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>Jesus started crying, </span> <span class="text John-11-36" id="en-CEV-24489"><sup class="versenum">36 </sup>and the people said, “See how much he loved Lazarus.”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-11-37" id="en-CEV-24490"><sup class="versenum">37 </sup>Some of them said, “He gives sight to the blind. Why couldn't he have kept Lazarus from dying?”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-11-38" id="en-CEV-24491"><sup class="versenum">38 </sup>Jesus was still terribly upset. So he went to the tomb, which was a cave with a stone rolled against the entrance. </span> <span class="text John-11-39" id="en-CEV-24492"><sup class="versenum">39 </sup>Then he told the people to roll the stone away. But Martha said, “Lord, you know that Lazarus has been dead four days, and there will be a bad smell.”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-11-40" id="en-CEV-24493"><sup class="versenum">40 </sup>Jesus replied, “Didn't I tell you that if you had faith, you would see the glory of God?”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-11-41" id="en-CEV-24494"><sup class="versenum">41 </sup>After the stone had been rolled aside, Jesus looked up toward heaven and prayed, “Father, I thank you for answering my prayer. </span> <span class="text John-11-42" id="en-CEV-24495"><sup class="versenum">42 </sup>I know that you always answer my prayers. But I said this, so the people here would believe you sent me.”</span></p> <p><span class="text John-11-43" id="en-CEV-24496"><sup class="versenum">43 </sup>When Jesus had finished praying, he shouted, “Lazarus, come out!” </span> <span class="text John-11-44" id="en-CEV-24497"><sup class="versenum">44 </sup>The man who had been dead came out. His hands and feet were wrapped with strips of burial cloth, and a cloth covered his face.</span></p><p><span class="text John-11-44">Jesus then told the people, “Untie him and let him go.”</span></p> <h3><span class="text John-11-45" id="en-CEV-24498">The Plot To Kill Jesus</span></h3><h4 class="reference"><span class="text John-11-45">(<a class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Matt.26.1-Matt.26.5" href="/passage/?search=Matt.26.1-Matt.26.5&amp;version=CEV">Matthew 26.1-5</a>; <a class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Mark.14.1" href="/passage/?search=Mark.14.1&amp;version=CEV">Mark 14.1</a>,<a class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Mark.14.2" href="/passage/?search=Mark.14.2&amp;version=CEV">2</a>; <a class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Luke.22.1" href="/passage/?search=Luke.22.1&amp;version=CEV">Luke 22.1</a>,<a class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Luke.22.2" href="/passage/?search=Luke.22.2&amp;version=CEV">2</a>)</span></h4><p><span class="text John-11-45"><sup class="versenum">45 </sup>Many of the people who had come to visit Mary saw the things Jesus did, and they put their faith in him. </span> <span class="text John-11-46" id="en-CEV-24499"><sup class="versenum">46 </sup>Others went to the Pharisees and told what Jesus had done. </span> <span class="text John-11-47" id="en-CEV-24500"><sup class="versenum">47 </sup>Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called the council together and said, “What should we do?
