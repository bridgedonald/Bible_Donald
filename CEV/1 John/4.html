<h3><span class="text 1John-4-1" id="en-CEV-28483">God Is Love</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text 1John-4-1"><span class="chapternum">4 </span>Dear friends, don't believe everyone who claims to have the Spirit of God. Test them all to find out if they really do come from God. Many false prophets have already gone out into the world, </span> <span class="text 1John-4-2" id="en-CEV-28484"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>and you can know which ones come from God. His Spirit says that Jesus Christ had a truly human body. </span> <span class="text 1John-4-3" id="en-CEV-28485"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>But when someone doesn't say this about Jesus, you know this person has a spirit that doesn't come from God and is the enemy of Christ. You knew this enemy was coming into the world and now is already here.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1John-4-4" id="en-CEV-28486"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Children, you belong to God, and you have defeated these enemies. God's Spirit<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28486a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28486a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28486a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> is in you and is more powerful than the one who is in the world. </span> <span class="text 1John-4-5" id="en-CEV-28487"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>These enemies belong to this world, and the world listens to them, because they speak its language. </span> <span class="text 1John-4-6" id="en-CEV-28488"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>We belong to God, and everyone who knows God will listen to us. But the people who don't know God won't listen to us. This is how we can tell the Spirit that speaks the truth from the one that tells lies.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1John-4-7" id="en-CEV-28489"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>My dear friends, we must love each other. Love comes from God, and when we love each other, it shows we have been given new life. We are now God's children, and we know him. </span> <span class="text 1John-4-8" id="en-CEV-28490"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>God is love, and anyone who doesn't love others has never known him. </span> <span class="text 1John-4-9" id="en-CEV-28491"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>God showed his love for us when he sent his only Son into the world to give us life. </span> <span class="text 1John-4-10" id="en-CEV-28492"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Real love isn't our love for God, but his love for us. God sent his Son to be the sacrifice by which our sins are forgiven. </span> <span class="text 1John-4-11" id="en-CEV-28493"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Dear friends, since God loved us this much, we must love each other.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1John-4-12" id="en-CEV-28494"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup> No one has ever seen God. But if we love each other, God lives in us, and his love is truly in our hearts.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1John-4-13" id="en-CEV-28495"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>God has given us his Spirit. This is how we know we are one with him, just as he is one with us. </span> <span class="text 1John-4-14" id="en-CEV-28496"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>God sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. We saw his Son and are now telling others about him. </span> <span class="text 1John-4-15" id="en-CEV-28497"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>God stays one with everyone who openly says Jesus is the Son of God. This is how we stay one with God </span> <span class="text 1John-4-16" id="en-CEV-28498"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>and are sure God loves us.</span></p><p><span class="text 1John-4-16">God is love. If we keep on loving others, we will stay one in our hearts with God, and he will stay one with us. </span> <span class="text 1John-4-17" id="en-CEV-28499"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>If we truly love others and live as Christ did in this world, we won't be worried about the day of judgment. </span> <span class="text 1John-4-18" id="en-CEV-28500"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>A real love for others will chase those worries away. The thought of being punished is what makes us afraid. It shows we have not really learned to love.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1John-4-19" id="en-CEV-28501"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>We love because God loved us first. </span> <span class="text 1John-4-20" id="en-CEV-28502"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>But if we say we love God and don't love each other, we are liars. We cannot see God. So how can we love God, if we don't love the people we can see? </span> <span class="text 1John-4-21" id="en-CEV-28503"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>The commandment that God has given us is: “Love God and love each other!”</span></p> <div class="footnotes">
