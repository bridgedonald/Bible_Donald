He loves us so much that he lets us be called his children, as we truly are. But since the people of this world did not know who Christ<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-CEV-28459a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-CEV-28459a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-CEV-28459a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> is, they don't know who we are. </span> <span class="text 1John-3-2" id="en-CEV-28460"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>My dear friends, we are already God's children, though what we will be hasn't yet been seen.

He isn't sinful, </span> <span class="text 1John-3-6" id="en-CEV-28464"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>and people who stay one in their hearts with him won't keep on sinning.
